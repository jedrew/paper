abstract = {Supernova explosions in a cloudy interstellar medium produce a three-component medium in which a large fraction of the volume is filled with hot, tenuous gas. In the disk of the galaxy the evolution of supernova remnants is altered by evaporation of cool clouds embedded in the hot medium. Radiative losses are enhanced by the resulting increase in density and by radiation from the conductive interfaces between clouds and hot gas. Mass balance (cloud evaporation rate = dense shell formation rate) and energy balance (supernova shock input = radiation loss) determine the density and temperature of the hot medium. A self-consistent model of the interstellar medium developed herein accounts for the observed pressure of interstellar clouds, the galactic soft X-ray background, the O VI absorption line observations, the ionization and heating of much of the interstellar medium, and the motions of the clouds.},

abstract = {The discovery of large numbers of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over the past decade has made it possible to investigate star formation and early evolution in a previously unexplored mass regime. In this review, we begin by describing surveys for low-mass members of nearby associations, open clusters, star-forming regions, and the methods used to characterize their stellar properties. We then use observations of these populations to test theories of star formation and evolution at low masses. For comparison to the formation models, we consider the initial mass function, stellar multiplicity, circumstellar disks, protostellar characteristics, and kinematic and spatial distributions at birth for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. To test the evolutionary models, we focus on measurements of dynamical masses and empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for young brown dwarfs and planetary companions.},

abstract = {Context: Thanks to recent large-scale surveys in the near infrared, such as 2MASS, the galactic plane that most suffers from extinction is revealed so its overall structure can be studied. Aims: This work aims at constraining the structure of the Milky Way external disc as seen in 2MASS data, and in particular the warp. Methods: We use the Two Micron All Sky Survey (hereafter 2MASS) along with the Stellar Population Synthesis Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besan\c{c}on, to constrain the external disc parameters, such as its scale length, its cutoff radius, and the slope of the warp. To properly interpret the observations, the simulated stars are reddened using a 3D extinction map. The shape of the stellar warp is then compared with previous results and with similar structures in gas and dust. Results: We find new constraints on the stellar disc, which is shown to be asymmetrical, similar to observations of HI. The positive longitude side is found to be easily modelled with S-shaped warp but with a significantly smaller slope than the one seen in the HI warp. At negative longitudes, the disc presents peculiarities that are not reproduced well by any simple model. Finally, comparing with the warp seen in the dust, it seems to follow an intermediate slope between the gas and the stars.},

abstract = {We have used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 to explore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the Milky Way using \~{}4 million color-selected main-sequence turnoff stars with 0.2\&lt;g-r\&lt;0.4 and 18.5\&lt;=r\&lt;22.5. We fit oblate and triaxial broken power law models to the data, and found a ``best-fit'' oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5\&lt;c/a\&lt;0.8, and halo stellar masses between galactocentric radii of 1 and 40 kpc of 3.7+/-1.2×108 Msolar. The density profile of the stellar halo is approximately $\rho$\~{}r-$\alpha$, where -2\&gt;$\alpha$\&gt;-4. Yet, we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to the distribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal of spatial substructure. We quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxial model using the rms of the data around the model profile on scales \&gt;\~{}100 pc, after accounting for the (known) contribution of Poisson uncertainties. Within the DR5 area of the SDSS, the fractional rms deviation $\sigma$/total of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth, parameterized halo model is \&gt;\~{}40\%: hence, the stellar halo is highly structured. We compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellar halos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmological context by analyzing the simulations in the same way as the SDSS data. While the masses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellar halos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure in the Milky Way's halo match well the properties of a ``typical'' stellar halo built exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies. Our results therefore point toward a picture in which an important fraction of the stellar halo of the Milky Way has been accreted from satellite galaxies.},

@article{Schlegel1998,
abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux \~{}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

The population synthesis approach is a useful tool to interpret such data sets and to test scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. We present here new constraints on evolution parameters obtained from the Besan\c{c}on model of population synthesis and analysis of optical and near-infrared star counts. The Galactic potential is computed self-consistently, in agreement with Hipparcos results and the observed rotation curve. Constraints are posed on the outer bulge structure, the warped and flared disc, the thick disc and the spheroid populations. The model is tuned to produce reliable predictions in the visible and the near-infrared in wide photometric bands from U to K. Finally, we describe applications such as photometric and astrometric simulations and a new classification tool based on a Bayesian probability estimator, which could be used in the framework of Virtual Observatories. As examples, samples of simulated star counts at different wavelengths and directions are also given.},

abstract = {Aims: We examine radial and vertical metallicity gradients using a suite of disk galaxy hydrodynamical simulations, supplemented with two classic chemical evolution approaches. We determine the rate of change of gradient slope and reconcile the differences existing between extant models and observations within the canonical "inside-out" disk growth paradigm. Methods: A suite of 25 cosmological disks is used to examine the evolution of metallicity gradients; this consists of 19 galaxies selected from the RaDES (Ramses Disk Environment Study) sample, realised with the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses, including eight drawn from the "field" and six from "loose group" environments. Four disks are selected from the MUGS (McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations) sample, generated with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code gasoline. Two chemical evolution models of inside-out disk growth were employed to contrast the temporal evolution of their radial gradients with those of the simulations. Results: We first show that generically flatter gradients are observed at redshift zero when comparing older stars with those forming today, consistent with expectations of kinematically hot simulations, but counter to that observed in the Milky Way. The vertical abundance gradients at \~{}1-3 disk scalelengths are comparable to those observed in the thick disk of the Milky Way, but significantly shallower than those seen in the thin disk. Most importantly, we find that systematic differences exist between the predicted evolution of radial abundance gradients in the RaDES and chemical evolution models, compared with the MUGS sample; specifically, the MUGS simulations are systematically steeper at high-redshift, and present much more rapid evolution in their gradients. Conclusions: We find that the majority of the models predict radial gradients today which are consistent with those observed in late-type disks, but they evolve to this self-similarity in different fashions, despite each adhering to classical "inside-out" growth. We find that radial dependence of the efficiency with which stars form as a function of time drives the differences seen in the gradients; systematic differences in the sub-grid physics between the various codes are responsible for setting these gradients. Recent, albeit limited, data at redshift z \~{} 1.5 are consistent with the steeper gradients seen in our SPH sample, suggesting a modest revision of the classical chemical evolution models may be required.},

@article{Bonatto2006,
abstract = {We use the open clusters (OCs) with known parameters available in the WEBDA database and in recently published papers to derive properties related to the disk structure such as the thin-disk scale height, displacement of the Sun above the Galactic plane, scale length and the OC age-distribution function. The sample totals 654 OCs, consisting basically of Trumpler types I to III clusters whose spatial distribution traces out the local geometry of the Galaxy. We find that the population of OCs with ages younger than 200 Myr distributes in the disk following an exponential-decay profile with a scale height of zh=48±3 pc. For the clusters with ages in the range 200 Myr to 1 Gyr we derive zh=150±27 pc. Clusters older than 1 Gyr distribute nearly uniformly in height from the plane so that no scale height can be derived from exponential fits. Considering clusters of all ages we obtain an average scale height of zh=57±3 pc. We confirm previous results that zh increases with Galactocentric distance. The scale height implied by the OCs younger than 1 Gyr outside the Solar circle is a factor ˜1.4-2 larger than zh of those interior to the Solar circle. We derive the displacement of the Sun above the Galactic plane as zȯ=14.8±2.4 pc, which agrees with previous determinations using stars. As a consequence of the completeness effects, the observed radial distribution of OCs with respect to Galactocentric distance does not follow the expected exponential profile, instead it falls off both for regions external to the Solar circle and more sharply towards the Galactic center. We simulate the effects of completeness assuming that the observed distribution of the number of OCs with a given number of stars above the background, measured in a restricted zone outside the Solar circle, is representative of the intrinsic distribution of OCs throughout the Galaxy. Two simulation models are considered in which the intrinsic number of observable stars are distributed: (i) assuming the actual positions of the OCs in the sample, and (ii) random selection of OC positions. As a result we derive completeness-corrected radial distributions which agree with exponential disks throughout the observed Galactocentric distance range 5-14 kpc, with scale lengths in the range RD=1.5-1.9 kpc, smaller than those inferred by means of stars. In particular we retrieve the expected exponential-disk radial profile for the highly depleted regions internal to the Solar circle. The smaller values of RD may reflect intrinsic differences in the spatial distributions of OCs and stars. We derive a number-density of Solar-neighbourhood (with distances from the Sun dȯ≤1.3 kpc) OCs of $\rho$ȯ=795±70 kpc-3, which implies a total number of (Trumpler types I to III) OCs of ˜730 of which ˜47\% would already have been observed. Extrapolation of the completeness-corrected radial distributions down to the Galactic center indicates a total number of OCs in the range (1.8-3.7)×105. These estimates are upper-limits because they do not take into account depletion in the number of OCs by dynamical effects in the inner parts of the Galaxy. The observed and completeness-corrected age-distributions of the OCs can be fitted by a combination of two exponential-decay profiles which can be identified with the young and old OC populations, characterized by age scales of ˜100 Myr and ˜1.9 Gyr, respectively. This rules out evolutionary scenarios based on constant star-formation and OC-disruption rates. Comparing the number of observed embedded clusters and candidates in the literature with the expected fraction of very young OCs, derived from the observed age-distribution function, we estimate that 3.4-8\% of the embedded clusters do actually emerge from the parent molecular clouds as OCs.},

We rederive the solar motion and the structure of the local velocity ellipsoids. When the principal velocity dispersions are assumed to increase with time as t$\beta$, the index $\beta$ is larger for $\sigma$W ($\beta$W \~{} 0.45) than for $\sigma$U ($\beta$U \~{} 0.31). For the three-dimensional velocity dispersion, we obtain $\beta$ = 0.35. We exclude saturation of disc heating after \~{}3Gyr as proposed by Quillen \&amp; Garnett. Saturation after \&gt;\~{}4Gyr combined with an abrupt increase in velocity dispersion for the oldest stars cannot be excluded. For all our models, the star formation rate (SFR) is declining, being a factor of 2-7 lower now than it was at the beginning. Models in which the SFR declines exponentially favour very high disc ages between 11.5 and 13Gyr and exclude ages below \~{}10.5Gyr as they yield worse fits to the number density and velocity dispersion of red stars. Models in which the SFR is the sum of two declining exponentials representing the thin and thick discs favour ages between 10.5 and 12Gyr with a lower limit of \~{}10.0Gyr. Although in our models the SFR peaked surprisingly early, the mean formation time of solar-neighbourhood stars is later than in ab initio models of galaxy formation, probably on account of weaknesses in such models.},

abstract = {We compare the spatial, kinematic, and metallicity distributions of stars in the Milky Way disk, as observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Geneva-Copenhagen Survey, to predictions made by N-body simulations that naturally include radial migration as proposed by Sellwood \&amp; Binney. In these simulations, stars that migrate radially outward feel a decreased restoring force, consequentially they reach larger heights above the mid-plane. We find that this model is in qualitative agreement with observational data and can explain the disk's double-exponential vertical structure and other characteristics as due to internal evolution. In particular, the model reproduces observations of stars in the transition region between exponential components, which do not show a strong correlation between rotational velocity and metallicity. Although such a correlation is present in young stars because of epicyclic motions, radial migration efficiently mixes older stars and weakens the correlation. Classifying stars as members of the thin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparent separation in the other property, as observed. We find a much stronger separation when using [$\alpha$/Fe], which is a good proxy for stellar age. The model success is remarkable because the simulation was not tuned to reproduce the Galaxy, hinting that the thick disk may be a ubiquitous Galactic feature generated by stellar migration. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that some fraction of the thick disk is a fossil of a more violent history, nor can radial migration explain thick disks in all galaxies, most strikingly those which counterrotate with respect to the thin disk.},

abstract = {New large-scale CO surveys of the first and second Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the CfA 1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other surveys obtained over the past two decades with that instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8deg) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4deg-10deg wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4deg sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. Each of the component surveys was integrated individually using clipping or moment masking to produce composite spatial and longitude-velocity maps of the Galaxy that display nearly all of the statistically significant emission in each survey but little noise. The composite maps provide detailed information on individual molecular clouds, suggest relationships between clouds and regions widely separated on the sky, and clearly display the main structural features of the molecular Galaxy. In addition, since the gas, dust, and Population I objects associated with molecular clouds contribute to the Galactic emission in every major wavelength band, the precise kinematic information provided by the present survey will form the foundation for many large-scale Galactic studies. A map of molecular column density predicted from complete and unbiased far-infrared and 21 cm surveys of the Galaxy was used both to determine the completeness of the present survey and to extrapolate it to the entire sky at |b|<32deg. The close agreement of the observed and predicted maps implies that only \~{}2\% of the total CO emission at |b|<32deg lies outside our current sampling, mainly in the regions of Chamaeleon and the Gum Nebula. Taking into account this small amount of unobserved emission, the mean molecular column density decreases from \~{}3×1020 cm-2 at |b|=5deg to \~{}0.1×1020 cm-2 at |b|=30deg this drop is \~{}6 times steeper than would be expected from a plane-parallel layer, but is consistent with recent measurements of the mean molecular column density at higher latitudes. The ratio of the predicted molecular column density map to the observed CO intensity map provides a calibration of the CO-to-H2 mass conversion factor X≡NH2/WCO. Out of the Galactic plane (|b|>5deg), X shows little systematic variation with latitude from a mean value of (1.8+/-0.3)×1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s. Given the large sky area and large quantity of CO data analyzed, we conclude that this is the most reliable measurement to date of the mean X value in the solar neighborhood.},

abstract = {We present a model of the Galaxy to reproduce star counts in the R, I, J, H, K, L, (12 micrometer) and (25 micrometer) bands, for any given direction and sensitivity. The Galaxy is represented as the sum of a spheroidal component given by a Hernquist density law, two disk components with scale heights 100 pc and 390 pc, and a spiral arm structure. Absolute magnitudes in each spectral band and for each luminosity class are obtained from V-lambda color indices, presented in form of polynomial fits as a function of spectral type. The interstellar extinction is taken into account, based on the known distribution of galactic gas in atomic and molecular forms. The contribution of circumstellar dust shells to the luminosity of late type giants and supergiants is studied and taken into account; all giant stars later than M6 are found to present a dust shell. The effect of the large amplitude of variability of these stars is also considered. The model predictions have not been compared with observations for all the bands included in our code due to the lack of observational data. Extensive comparisons are presented for the K band, over the 1-11 magnitude range for many directions in the Galaxy, and comparisons with the IRAS point source catalog (PSC) are presented at 12 micrometers and 25 micrometers. The model reproduces correctly the overall star counts in the K band, at 12 micrometers and at 25 micrometers, although an increase of the parameter representing the intensity of the spiral structure is required for the IRAS bands, and our description of the local arm (l = 80 deg) is not yet satisfactory. The scale-length of the disk is found to be about 2.6 kpc for the 390 pc disk, and seems to be larger (about 4 kpc) for the 100 pc disk, which contains a younger population.},

It agrees very well with the data, except in directions in which the near- infrared optical depth is high. Among the conclusions drawn from the model: The Sun is located approximately 16.5 pc above the midpoint of the Galactic plane. The disk has an outer edge four kpc from the Sun, and is warped like the HI layer. It has a central hole roughly the diameter of the inner edge of the "three-kiloparsec" molecular cloud ring, and within that hole lies a bright, strong, "early-type" bar, tilted approximately 14 degrees from the Sun-Galactic center line. The model has 47 free parameters. The model is discussed in detail and contour plots and images of the residuals presented.},

abstract = {The Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS) is a 1800-deg2 CCD survey of the northern Milky Way spanning the latitude range -5° < b < + 5° and reaching down to r'\~{}= 20 (10$\sigma$). Representative observations and an assessment of point-source data from IPHAS, now underway, are presented. The data obtained are Wide Field Camera images in the H$\alpha$ narrow-band, and Sloan r' and i' broad-band filters. We simulate IPHAS (r'-H$\alpha$,r'-i') point-source colours using a spectrophotometric library of stellar spectra and available filter transmission profiles: this defines the expected colour properties of (i) solar metallicity stars, without H$\alpha$ emission, and (ii) emission-line stars. Comparisons with observations of fields in Aquila show that the simulations of normal star colours reproduce the observations well for all spectral types earlier than M. A further comparison between colours synthesized from long-slit flux-calibrated spectra and IPHAS photometry for six objects in a Taurus field confirms the reliability of the pipeline calibration. Spectroscopic follow-up of a field in Cepheus shows that sources lying above the main stellar locus in the (r'- H$\alpha$,r'-i') plane are confirmed to be emission-line objects with very few failures. In this same field, examples of H$\alpha$ deficit objects (a white dwarf and a carbon star) are shown to be readily distinguished by their IPHAS colours. The role IPHAS can play in studies of spatially resolved northern Galactic nebulae is discussed briefly and illustrated by a continuum-subtracted mosaic image of Shajn 147 (a supernova remnant, 3° in diameter). The final catalogue of IPHAS point sources will contain photometry on about 80 million objects. Used on its own, or in combination with near-infrared photometric catalogues, IPHAS is a major resource for the study of stellar populations making up the disc of the Milky Way. The eventual yield of new northern emission-line objects from IPHAS is likely to be an order of magnitude increase on the number already known.},

Unique aspects of the survey are that it concentrates on regions of sky that are easily accessible from telescopes in both Northern and Southern terrestrial hemispheres and that it is the first public survey to use filters similar to that being used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A major aim of the the INT Wide Field Survey programme is to bridge the gap between the all-sky photographic 2 band surveys such as Palomar and UK Schmidt sky surveys and the ultra-deep keyhole survey such as the Hubble Deep Field.

Based on an apparent blue limit to the colors of stars with metallicities near -0.5, this population is found to be very old: similar to the disk globular cluster 47 Tuc.

abstract = {We re-examine recent claims of observational evidence for a dual Galactic halo in SEGUE/SDSS data, and trace them back to improper error treatment and neglect of selection effects. In particular, the detection of a vertical abundance gradient in the halo can be explained as a metallicity bias in distance. A similar bias and the impact of disk contamination affect the sample of blue horizontal branch stars. These examples highlight why non-volume complete samples require forward modeling from theoretical models or extensive bias-corrections. We also show how observational uncertainties produce the specific non-Gaussianity in the observed azimuthal velocity distribution of halo stars, which can be erroneously identified as two Gaussian components. A single kinematic component yields an excellent fit to the observed data, when we model the measurement process including distance uncertainties. Furthermore, we show that sample differences in proper motion space are the direct consequence of kinematic cuts and are enhanced when distance estimates are less accurate. Thus, their presence is neither proof of a separate population nor a measure of reliability for the applied distances. We conclude that currently there is no evidence from SEGUE/SDSS that would favor a dual Galactic halo over a single halo that is full of substructure.},

For satellites with masses in the range 0.04-0.2 Mdisk on initially circular inclined prograde orbits merging with disks similar to the thin disk of the Galaxy, it is found that the dynamical coupling between disks and satellites leads to orbital decay. Disks respond to mergers by spreading both radially and vertically. The radial heating is driven largely by the spiral response of the dynamically cool disks to satellite perturbations.},

Earlier analysis of the DIRBE observations (Weiland et al. 1994) provided supporting evidence for the claim made by Blitz \&amp; Spergel (1991) that the bulge is bar-shaped with its near end in the first Galactic quadrant. Adopting various triaxial analytical functions to represent the volume emissivity of the source, we confirm the barlike nature of the bulge and show that triaxial Gaussian-type functions provide a better fit to the data than other classes of functions, including an axisymmetric spheroid. The introduction of a `boxy' geometry, such as the one used by Kent, Dame, \&amp; Fazio (1991) improves the fit to the data. Our results show that the bar is rotated in the plane with its near side in the first Galactic quadrant creating an angle of 20 deg +/- 10 deg between its major axis and the line of sight to the Galactic center. Typical axis ratios of the bar are (1:0.33 +/- 0.11:0.23 +/- 0.08), resembling the geometry of prolate spheroids. There is no statistically significant evidence for an out-of-plane tilt of the bar at 2.2 microns, and marginal evidence for a tilt of approximately equal 2 deg at 4.9 microns. The introduction of a roll around the intrinsic major axis of the bulge improves the `boxy' appearance of some functions. A simple integration of the observed projected intensity of the bulge gives a bulge luminosity of 1.2 x 109, 4.1 x 108, 2.3 x 108, and 4.3 x 107 solar luminosity, respectively, at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, and 4.9 microns wavelength for a Galactocentric distance of 8.5 kpc. The 2.2 microns luminosity function of the bulge population in the direction of Baade's window yields a bolometric luminosity of Lbol = 5.3 x 109 solar luminosity. Stellar evolutionary models relate this luminosity to the number of main-sequence progenitor stars that currently populate the red giant branch. Combined with the recent determination of the main-sequence turnoff mass for the bulge by the Hubble Space Telescope (Holtzman et al. 1993) we derive a photometrically determined bulge mass of approximately equal to 1.3 x 1010 solar mass for a Salpeter initial mass function extended down to 0.1 solar mass.},

Methods: To study the characteristics of the stellar populations and the metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge, we compared the output of the galaxy model TRILEGAL, which implements the Binney et al.

A minimisation procedure has been set up to retrieve the best fitting model with different stellar populations and metallicity distributions. Results: Using the TRILEGAL code we find that the best model resembling the characteristics of the Galactic bulge is a model with the distance to the Galactic centre R0 = 8.7± 0.570.43 kpc, the major axis ratios of the bar 1\{:\}$\eta$ \{:\}zeta = 1\{:\}0.68±0.190.05\{:\} 0.31±0.040.06, and the angle between the Sun-centre line and the bar $\phi$ = 15\^{}circ ± 12.713.3. Using these parameters the best model is found for a burst of 8 Gyr, although it is almost indistinguishable from models with ages of 9 and 10 Gyr.

Because APOGEE will observe in the H band, where the extinction is six times smaller than in V, it will be the first survey to pierce through Galactic dust and provide a vast, uniform database of chemical abundances and radial velocities for stars across all Galactic populations (bulge, disk, and halo). The survey will be conducted with a dedicated, 300-fiber, cryogenic, spectrograph that is being built at the University of Virginia, coupled to the ARC 2.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. APOGEE will use a significant fraction of the SDSS-III bright time during a three-year period to observe, at high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N> 100), about 100 000 giant stars selected directly from 2MASS down to a typical flux limit of H<13. The main scientific objectives of APOGEE are: (1) measuring unbiased metallicity distributions and abundance patterns for the different Galactic stellar populations, (2) studying the processes of star formation, feedback, and chemical mixing in the Milky Way, (3) surveying the dynamics of the bulge and disk, placing constraints on the nature and influence of the Galactic bar and spiral arms, and (4) using extensive chemodynamical data, particularly in the inner Galaxy, to unravel its formation and evolution.},

The resulting age-velocity-dispersion relation rises fairly steeply for stars less than 6 Gyr old, thereafter becoming nearly constant with age. These data are consistent with a simple model in which no local disk is initially present, following which stars are born at a constant rate in time and heated by transient spiral waves.

abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z \&gt; 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z \~{} 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z \~{} 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

abstract = {It has been believed that spiral arms in pure stellar disks, especially the ones spontaneously formed, decay in several galactic rotations due to the increase of stellar velocity dispersions. Therefore, some cooling mechanism, for example dissipational effects of the interstellar medium, was assumed to be necessary to keep the spiral arms. Here, we show that stellar disks can maintain spiral features for several tens of rotations without the help of cooling, using a series of high-resolution three-dimensional N-body simulations of pure stellar disks. We found that if the number of particles is sufficiently large, e.g., 3 × 106, multi-arm spirals developed in an isolated disk can survive for more than 10 Gyr. We confirmed that there is a self-regulating mechanism that maintains the amplitude of the spiral arms. Spiral arms increase Toomre's Q of the disk, and the heating rate correlates with the squared amplitude of the spirals. Since the amplitude itself is limited by Q, this makes the dynamical heating less effective in the later phase of evolution. A simple analytical argument suggests that the heating is caused by gravitational scattering of stars by spiral arms and that the self-regulating mechanism in pure stellar disks can effectively maintain spiral arms on a cosmological timescale. In the case of a smaller number of particles, e.g., 3 × 105, spiral arms grow faster in the beginning of the simulation (while Q is small) and they cause a rapid increase of Q. As a result, the spiral arms become faint in several Gyr.},

The IPHAS catalogue of H$\alpha$-emitting stars provides a useful basis for this study since all sources present in this catalogue must be of small angular diameter. Methods: The PN candidates are selected based on their location in two colour-colour diagrams: IPHAS (r' - H$\alpha$) vs. (r' - i'), and 2MASS (J - H) vs. (H - K\_s). Spectroscopic follow-up was carried out on a sample of candidates to confirm their nature.  Results: We present a total of 83 PN candidates. We were able to obtain spectra or find the classification from the literature for 35 candidates. Five of these objects are likely to be new PNe, including one large bipolar PN discovered serendipitously close to an emission-line star. PN distances deduced from extinction-distance relations based on IPHAS field-star photometry are presented for the first time. These yield distance estimates for our objects in the range 2 kpc and 6 kpc. From the data in hand, we conclude that four of the discovered objects are probably young PNe.},

abstract = {From a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 102 F and G dwarf stars we present abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks for 14 elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, and Eu). Stellar parameters and elemental abundances (except for Y, Ba and Eu) for 66 of the 102 stars were presented in our previous studies (Bensby et al. [CITE], A\&amp;A, 410, 527, [CITE], A\&amp;A, 415, 155). The 36 stars that are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results and allow us to draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. The s-process elements Y and Ba, and the r-element Eu have also been considered here for the whole sample for the first time. With this new larger sample we now have the following results: 1) smooth and distinct abundance trends that for the thin and thick disks are clearly separated; 2) the $\alpha$-element trends for the thick disk show typical signatures from the enrichment of SN Ia; 3) the thick disk stellar sample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) the thick disk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii (R\_m); 5) the thick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with vertical distance (Z\_max) from the Galactic plane. Adding further evidence from the literaure we argue that a merger/interacting scenario with a companion galaxy to produce a kinematical heating of the stars (that make up today's thick disk) in a pre-existing old thin disk is the most likely formation scenario for the Galactic thick disk. The 102 stars have -1 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.4 and are all in the solar neighbourhood. Based on their kinematics they have been divided into a thin disk sample and a thick disk sample consisting of 60 and 38 stars, respectively. The remaining 4 stars have kinematics that make them kinematically intermediate to the two disks. Their chemical abundances also place them in between the two disks. Which of the two disk populations these 4 stars belong to, or if they form a distinct population of their own, can at the moment not be settled. The 66 stars from our previous studies were observed with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5-m telescope and the CES spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m telescope. Of the 36 new stars presented here 30 were observed with the SOFIN spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, 3 with the UVES spectrograph on VLT/UT2, and 3 with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5-m telescope. All spectra have high signal-to-noise ratios (typically S/N≳ 250) and high resolution (R˜ 80 000, 45 000, and 110 000 for the SOFIN, FEROS, and UVES spectra, respectively).

As the majority of stars in the stream lie in the constellation of Aquarius, we name it the Aquarius Stream. We identify 15 members of the stream lying between 30° < l < 75° and -70° < b < -50°, with heliocentric line-of-sight velocities V los \~{} -200 km s-1. The members are outliers in the radial velocity distribution, and the overdensity is statistically significant when compared to mock samples created with both the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model and newly developed code Galaxia. The metallicity distribution function and isochrone fit in the log g-T eff plane suggest that the stream consists of a 10 Gyr old population with [M/H] \~{} -1.0. We explore relations to other streams and substructures, finding that the stream cannot be identified with known structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the Galaxy's halo. Using a simple dynamical model of a dissolving satellite galaxy, we account for the localization of the stream. We find that the stream is dynamically young and therefore likely the debris of a recently disrupted dwarf galaxy or globular cluster. The Aquarius stream is thus a specimen of ongoing hierarchical Galaxy formation, rare for being right in the solar suburb.},

abstract = {The heating of galactic disks through scattering by molecular clouds and spiral waves is investigated by solving the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation by Monte Carlo simulation. The vertical potential in the disk is handled in two ways: (1) by using a fixed and realistic anharmonic potential, or (2) by generating the potential self-consistently, assuming that the disk can be approximated as a 1D self-gravitating layer. The shape of the velocity ellipsoid is found to be little changed from earlier work in which a fixed harmonic potential was used. Self-consistent simulations have been run of coeval and star-forming disks with and without accretion. Predictions of the density distribution and the dependence of the vertical component of the velocity dispersion on height are made. It is found that the assumed strength of spiral heating does not significantly affect the shape of rho(z) or sigma-z(z). The age-velocity relation is derived for the accreting disk and a best fit is made to data from Wielen (1977).},

The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4+/-0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10\% of the \~{}4×106 Msolar deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of \~{}1022 Msolar pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 Msolar and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of ``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than \~{}104 Msolar between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

We discuss in detail the data processing carried out by the c2d team on IRAC data. More than 100,000 compact sources have been extracted, but we confine most of our discussion to the most reliable subset of these sources. This includes those that are detected above 7 $\sigma$ in all four IRAC bands or those detected in the two shorter IRAC bands together with 2MASS. We estimate completeness limits for our survey from Monte Carlo tests with artificial sources inserted into the Spitzer maps. We compare source counts, colors, and magnitudes in the Serpens cloud to two reference data sets, a 0.10 deg2 set of low-extinction regions near the dark cloud and a 1 deg2 subset of the SWIRE Elais N1 data that was processed through our pipeline. We find that it is possible to identify more than 200 young stellar object (YSO) candidates from color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, most of which were previously unknown. In addition to the dense area of new star formation known before in the ``core'' region (cluster A), we also find a moderately rich area to the south (cluster B). Our mapped area also includes the Herbig Ae star VV Ser, whose Spitzer images have been carefully modeled in a separate study. The extreme sensitivity of Spitzer IRAC allows us to search to very low luminosity limits for young substellar objects. The comparison of the Serpens region with the reference areas suggests that a population of infrared excess sources exists in Serpens at least down to luminosities of L\~{}10-3 Lsolar and possibly lower.},

abstract = {The monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situ measurements of the response function of the mosaicked CCD imager used in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The system is outlined and the results of the measurements, mostly during the first six years of the SDSS, are described. We present the reference response functions for the five color passbands derived from these measurements, and discuss column-to-column variations and variations in time, and also their effects on photometry. We also discuss the effect arising from various, slightly different response functions of the associated detector systems that were used to give SDSS photometry. We show that the calibration procedures of SDSS remove these variations reasonably well with the resulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to be larger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of the survey. The considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the response function showing a 30\% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental sensitivity in the u band, which is calibrated out. The expected color variation is consistent with measured color variation in the catalog of repeated photometry. The color variation is $\Delta$(u - g) \~{} 0.01 for most stars, and at most $\Delta$(u - g) \~{} 0.02 mag for those with extreme colors. We verified in the final catalog that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag are detected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonal effects except for the secular u - g color variation for stars with extreme colors.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the asymmetries in the population of Galactic M-giant stars present in the 2MASS All Sky catalogue. Several large-scale asymmetries are detected, the most significant of which is a strong elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity, close to the Galactic plane at (l= 240°, b=-8°), in the constellation of Canis Major. A small grouping of globular clusters (NGC 1851, 1904, 2298 and 2808), coincident in position and radial velocity, surround this structure, as do a number of open clusters. The population of M-giant stars in this overdensity is similar in number to that in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We argue that this object is the likely dwarf galaxy progenitor of the ring-like structure that has recently been found at the edge of the Galactic disc. A numerical study of the tidal disruption of an accreted dwarf galaxy is presented. The simulated debris fits the extant position, distance and velocity information on the Galactic `Ring', as well as that of the M-giant overdensities, suggesting that all these structures are the consequence of a single accretion event. The disrupted dwarf galaxy stream orbits close to the Galactic plane, with a pericentre at approximately the solar circle, an orbital eccentricity similar to that of stars in the Galactic thick disc, as well as a vertical scaleheight similar to that of the thick disc. This finding strongly suggests that the Canis Major dwarf galaxy is a building block of the Galactic thick disc, that the thick disc is continually growing, even up to the present time, and that thick disc globular clusters were accreted on to the Milky Way from dwarf galaxies in co-planar orbits.},

abstract = {A chromospheric age distribution of 552 late-type dwarfs is transformed into a star formation history by the application of scale height corrections, stellar evolutionary corrections and volume corrections. We show that the disk of our Galaxy has experienced enhanced episodes of star formation at 0-1 Gyr, 2-5 Gyr and 7-9 Gyr ago, although the reality of the latter burst is still uncertain. The star sample birthsites are distributed over a very large range of distances because of orbital diffusion, and so give an estimate of the global star formation rate. These results are compared with the metal-enrichment rate, given by the age-metallicity relation, with the expected epochs of close encounters between our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, and with previous determinations of the star formation history. Simulations are used to examine the age-dependent smearing of the star formation history due to age uncertainties, and the broadening of the recovered features, as well as to measure the probability level that the history derived to be produced by statistical fluctuations of a constant star formation history. We show, with a significance level greater than 98\%, that the Milky Way have not had a constant star formation history.},

The present investigation is concerned with an assessment of the accuracy of this method, taking into account a comparison of its reddening predictions to those of two independent and highly accurate methods, including the uvby-beta photometry of early-type stars and the strong absorption line-strength-color relationship for the integrated spectra of elliptical galaxies. On the basis of the results of the investigation, it is concluded that a reasonable estimate of the relative accuracy of the H I/galaxy counts method reported by Burstein and Heiles is 0.01 mag in E(B-V) or 10\% of the reddening, whichever is larger.},

abstract = {Results from numerical simulations of normal isolated late-type spiral galaxies are presented; specifically, the galaxy NGC 628 is used as a template. The method employs a TREESPH code including stellar particles, gas particles, cooling and heating of the gas, star formation according to a Jeans criterion and supernova feedback. A regular spiral disc can be generated as an equilibrium situation of two opposing actions: on the one hand, cooling and dissipation of the gas; on the other hand, gas heating by the far-ultraviolet field of young stars and supernova mechanical forcing. The disc exhibits small- and medium-scale spiral structure of which the multiplicity increases as a function of radius. The theory of swing amplification can explain, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the emerging spiral structure. In addition, swing amplification predicts that the existence of a grand-design m= 2 spiral is only possible if the disc is massive. The simulations show that the galaxy is then unstable to bar formation, confirming the result of Ostriker \&amp; Peebles. The occurrence of this bar instability is further investigated. A general criterion is derived for the transition between a stable and an unstable bar, depending on the disc mass contribution and the on-disc thickness. It seems that bar stability barely depends on the presence of gas. A detailed quantitative analysis is made of the emerging spiral structure and a comparison is made with observations. This demonstrates that the structure of the numerical isolated galaxies is not as strong and has a larger multiplicity compared with the structure of some exemplary real galaxies. It is argued that the suggestion of Kormendy \&amp; Norman holds, i.e. that a grand design can only be generated by a central bar or by tidal forces resulting from an encounter with another galaxy.},

abstract = {We employ measurements of the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio derived from low-resolution (R \~{} 2000) spectra of 17,277 G-type dwarfs from the SEGUE survey to separate them into likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples. Both subsamples exhibit strong gradients of orbital rotational velocity with metallicity, of opposite signs, -20 to -30 km s-1 dex-1 for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km s-1 dex-1 for the thick-disk population. The rotational velocity is uncorrelated with Galactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample and exhibits a small trend for the thick-disk subsample. The rotational velocity decreases with distance from the plane for both disk components, with similar slopes (-9.0 ± 1.0 km s-1 kpc-1). Thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital eccentricity with metallicity (about -0.2 dex-1), while the eccentricity does not change with metallicity for the thin-disk subsample. The eccentricity is almost independent of Galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginal gradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population. Both subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity with distance from the Galactic plane. The shapes of the eccentricity distributions for the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent of distance from the plane, and include no significant numbers of stars with eccentricity above 0.6. Among several contemporary models of disk evolution that we consider, radial migration appears to have played an important role in the evolution of the thin-disk population, but possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to the gas-rich merger or disk heating scenarios. We emphasize that more physically realistic models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry out the detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.},

@article{Chiappini1997,
abstract = {We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes two main infall episodes, for the formation of the halo-thick disk and thin disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available. Our model fits these new data very well. The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that, in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of <=1 Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation in the solar vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of the disk (R < 1 Rȯ) are steeper than in the outer regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of the star formation process are discussed.},

abstract = {We present and discuss new determinations of metallicity, rotation, age, kinematics, and Galactic orbits for a complete, magnitude-limited, and kinematically unbiased sample of 16 682 nearby F and G dwarf stars. Our ˜63 000 new, accurate radial-velocity observations for nearly 13 500 stars allow identification of most of the binary stars in the sample and, together with published uvby$\beta$ photometry, Hipparcos parallaxes, Tycho-2 proper motions, and a few earlier radial velocities, complete the kinematic information for 14 139 stars. These high-quality velocity data are supplemented by effective temperatures and metallicities newly derived from recent and/or revised calibrations. The remaining stars either lack Hipparcos data or have fast rotation. A major effort has been devoted to the determination of new isochrone ages for all stars for which this is possible. Particular attention has been given to a realistic treatment of statistical biases and error estimates, as standard techniques tend to underestimate these effects and introduce spurious features in the age distributions. Our ages agree well with those by Edvardsson et al. ($\backslash$cite\{edv93\}), despite several astrophysical and computational improvements since then. We demonstrate, however, how strong observational and theoretical biases cause the distribution of the observed ages to be very different from that of the true age distribution of the sample. Among the many basic relations of the Galactic disk that can be reinvestigated from the data presented here, we revisit the metallicity distribution of the G dwarfs and the age-metallicity, age-velocity, and metallicity-velocity relations of the Solar neighbourhood. Our first results confirm the lack of metal-poor G dwarfs relative to closed-box model predictions (the ``G dwarf problem''), the existence of radial metallicity gradients in the disk, the small change in mean metallicity of the thin disk since its formation and the substantial scatter in metallicity at all ages, and the continuing kinematic heating of the thin disk with an efficiency consistent with that expected for a combination of spiral arms and giant molecular clouds. Distinct features in the distribution of the V component of the space motion are extended in age and metallicity, corresponding to the effects of stochastic spiral waves rather than classical moving groups, and may complicate the identification of thick-disk stars from kinematic criteria. More advanced analyses of this rich material will require careful simulations of the selection criteria for the sample and the distribution of observational errors.

abstract = {The age-metallicity relation of the solar neighbourhood is studied using a sample of 552 late-type dwarfs. This sample was built from the intersection of photometric catalogues with chromospheric activity surveys of the Mount Wilson group. For these stars, metallicities were estimated from uvby data, and ages were calculated from their chromospheric emission levels using a new metallicity-dependent chromospheric activity-age relation developed by Rocha-Pinto \&amp; Maciel ($\backslash$cite\{RPM98\}). A careful estimate of the errors in the chromospheric age is made. The errors in the chromospheric indices are shown to include partially the effects of the stellar magnetic cycles, although a detailed treatment of this error is still beyond our knowledge. It is shown that the results are not affected by the presence of unresolved binaries in the sample. We derive an age-metallicity relation which confirms the mean trend found by previous workers. The mean metallicity shows a slow, steady increase with time, amounting at least 0.56 dex in 15 Gyr. The initial metallicity of the disk is around -0.70 dex, in agreement with the G dwarf metallicity distribution (Rocha-Pinto \&amp; Maciel $\backslash$cite\{RPM96\}). According to our data, the intrinsic cosmic dispersion in metal abundances is around 0.13 dex, a factor of two smaller than that found by Edvardsson et al. ($\backslash$cite\{Edv\}). We show that chromospheric ages are compatible with isochrone ages, within the expected errors, so that the difference in the scatter cannot be caused by the accuracy of our ages and metallicities. This reinforces some suggestions that the Edvarsson et al.'s sample is not suitable to the determination of the age-metallicity relation.},

abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

GAIA will provide positional and radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion stars throughout our Galaxy (and into the Local Group), amounting to about 1 percent of the Galactic stellar population. GAIA's main scientific goal is to clarify the origin and history of our Galaxy, from a quantitative census of the stellar populations. It will advance questions such as when the stars in our Galaxy formed, when and how it was assembled, and its distribution of dark matter. The survey aims for completeness to V=20 mag, with accuracies of about 10 mu as at 15 mag. Combined with astrophysical information for each star, provided by on-board multi-colour photometry and (limited) spectroscopy, these data will have the precision necessary to quantify the early formation, and subsequent dynamical, chemical and star formation evolution of our Galaxy. Additional products include detection and orbital classification of tens of thousands of extra-Solar planetary systems, and a comprehensive survey of some 105-106 minor bodies in our Solar System, through galaxies in the nearby Universe, to some 500 000 distant quasars. It will provide a number of stringent new tests of general relativity and cosmology.

abstract = {A description of spiral structure is presented that appears to account for both the imperfect grand-design nature of the patterns and the importance of gas. It is argued that most visible spirals are short-lived features organized by gravitational forces. The recurrent transient patterns are self-regulating since they cause the velocity dispersion of the stars to rise secularly until, in the absence of gas, the disk becomes stable. However, any method of cooling will ensure that the disk will never completely stabilize and will, consequently, exhibit recurrent spiral structure. Both dissipation in the gas and accretion will cool the disk and provoke instabilities. Transient spiral patterns in computer simulations are observed which recur repeatedly only when processes designed to mimic accretion and star formation are included. The models evolve at an equilibrium Q, implying that the rate of heating by the spirals balances the steady rate of cooling. It is also found that the growth of spiral patterns is in reasonable quantitative agreement with the predictions of 'swing amplification' theory. In a companion paper it is shown that this continuous activity leads naturally to the type of age-velocity dispersion relation observed for the solar neighborhood stars.},

@article{Lopez-Corredoira2002a,
abstract = {A new method is developed to calculate the amplitude of the galactic warps generated by a torque due to external forces. This takes into account that the warp is produced as a reorientation of the different rings which constitute the disc in order to compensate the differential precession generated by the external force, yielding a uniform asymptotic precession for all rings. Application of this method to gravitational tidal forces in the Milky Way due to the Magellanic Clouds leads to a very low amplitude of the warp, as has been inferred in previous studies; so, tidal forces are unlikely to generate warps, at least in the Milky Way. If the force were due to an extragalactic magnetic field, its intensity would have to be very high, greater than 1 mu G, to generate the observed warps. An alternative hypothesis is explored: the accretion of the intergalactic medium over the disk. A cup-shaped distortion is expected, due to the transmission of the linear momentum; but, this effect is small and the predominant effect turns out to be the transmission of angular momentum, i.e. a torque giving an integral-sign shape warp. The torque produced by a flow of velocity \~{} 100 km s-1 and baryon density \~{} 10-25 kg/m3 is enough to generate the observed warps and this mechanism offers quite a plausible explanation. First, because this order of accretion rate is inferred from other processes observed in the Galaxy, notably its chemical evolution. The inferred rate of infall of matter, \~{} 1 M\_sun/yr, to the Galactic disc that this theory predicts agrees with the quantitative predictions of this chemical evolution resolving key issues, notably the G-dwarf problem. Second, the required density of the intergalactic medium is within the range of values compatible with observation. By this mechanism, we can explain the warp phenomenon in terms of intergalactic accretion flows onto the disk of the galaxy.},

abstract = {Nearly 400 Tycho-2 stars have been observed in a 720 square degree field in the direction of the North Galactic Pole with the high resolution echelle spectrograph ELODIE. Absolute magnitudes, effective temperatures, gravities and metallicities have been estimated, as well as distances and 3D velocities. Most of these stars are clump giants and span typical distances from 200 pc to 800 pc to the galactic mid-plane. This new sample, free of any kinematical and metallicity bias, is used to investigate the vertical distribution of disk stars. The old thin disk and thick disk populations are deconvolved from the velocity-metallicity distribution of the sample and their parameters are determined. The thick disk is found to have a moderate rotational lag of -51 +/- 5 km s-1 with respect to the Sun with velocity ellipsoid (sigmaU , sigmaV , sigmaW )= (63+/- 6, 39+/- 4, 39+/- 4) km s-1, mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.48 +/- 0.05 and a high local normalization of 15 +/- 7\%. Combining this NGP sample with a local sample of giant stars from the Hipparcos catalogue, the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is investigated as a function of distance to the plane and metallicity. We find no vertex deviation for old stars, consistent with an axisymmetric Galaxy. Paper II is devoted to the dynamical analysis of the sample, puting new constraints on the vertical force perpendicular to the galactic plane and on the total mass density in the galactic plane.

abstract = {The paper presents results of a search for spectroscopic binaries among 135 bright field stars of types F3 - G2 IV or V. Orbital elements for 25 newly discovered spectroscopic binaries are derived from radial velocities measured in 20 coude spectra for each star, and velocity curves are also computed for each of these binaries. It is found that the ratios of observed singles:doubles:triples:quadruples among the 135 program stars are 42:46:9:2. The 88 computed and estimated periods show a relatively smooth distribution with a single maximum and a median period of 14 years. It is tentatively suggested that the discovered binaries show no pronounced grouping tendency in age or evolutionary state. The number of binaries not revealed is estimated, the secondary masses for both the observed and undetected binaries are determined statistically, and it is concluded that the short-period binaries are fission systems while the long-period systems are those in which pairs of protostars contracted separately. On the average, the multiple systems are found to be 0.22 magnitude brighter than the primaries alone.},

In the solar neighborhood, the scale height is about 247 pc, which is in agreement with star counts perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The scale height is not constant with the radius but decreases to about 165 pc. To the first order, the bulge can be represented by an oblate spheroid with an axis ratio of 0.61. The 2.2-micron/12-micron flux ratio for the bulge is typical of other dust-free spheroidal systems.

abstract = {We have imaged a sample of 45 face-on spiral galaxies in the K band, to determine the morphology of the old stellar population, which dominates the mass in the disc. The K-band images of the spiral galaxies have been used to calculate different characteristics of the underlying density perturbation such as arm strengths, profiles and cross-sections, and spiral pitch angles. Contrary to expectations, no correlation was found between arm pitch angle and Hubble type, and combined with previous results this leads us to conclude that the morphology of the old stellar population bears little resemblance to the optical morphology used to classify galaxies. The arm properties of our galaxies seem inconsistent with predictions from the simplest density wave theories, and some observations, such as variations in pitch angle within galaxies, seem hard to reconcile even with more complex modal theories. Bars have no detectable effect on arm strengths for the present sample. We have also obtained B-band images of three of the galaxies. For these galaxies we have measured arm cross-sections and strengths, to investigate the effects of disc density perturbations on star formation in spiral discs. We find that B-band arms lead K-band arms and are narrower than K-band arms, apparently supporting predictions made by the large-scale shock scenario, although the effects of dust on B-band images may contribute towards these results.},

abstract = {Aims.The Two Micron All Sky Survey, along with the Stellar Population Synthesis Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besan\c{c}on, is used to calculate the extinction distribution along different lines of sight. By combining many lines of sight, the large scale distribution of interstellar material can be deduced.Methods.The Galaxy model is used to provide the intrinsic colour of stars and their probable distances, so that the near infrared colour excess, and hence the extinction, may be calculated and its distance evaluated. Such a technique is dependent on the model used, however we are able to show that moderate changes in the model parameters result in insignificant changes in the predicted extinction. Results.This technique has now been applied to over 64 000 lines of sight, each separated by 15´, in the inner Galaxy (|l|≤ 100°, |b|≤ 10°). We have projected our three dimensional results onto a two dimensional plane in order to compare them with existing two dimensional extinction maps and CO surveys. We find that although differences exist due to the different methods used or the medium traced, the same large scale structures are visible in each of the different maps. Using our extinction map, we have derived the main characteristics of the large scale structure of the dust distribution. The scale height of the interstellar matter is found to be 125+17-7 pc. The dust distribution is found to be asymmetrically warped, in agreement with CO and HI observations of the ISM. However, the slope of the dust warp and the galactocentric distance where it starts are found to be smaller than the values measured for the external HI disc: for positive longitudes the angle is $\theta$= 89°, it starts at 8.7 kpc from the Galactic center and grows with a slope of 0.14, while at negative longitudes, the angle of the maximum is at $\theta$= 272°, the starting radius 7.8 kpc and the slope 0.11. Finally, the presence of dust is detected in the Galactic bulge. It forms an elongated structure approximately 5.2 kpc long and lies at an angle of 30 ± 5° with respect to the Sun-Galactic centre direction. This may be interpreted as a dust lane along the Galactic bar. This resulting extinction map will be useful for studies of the inner Galaxy and its stellar populations.},

@article{Cox2005,
abstract = {The interstellar medium in the vicinity of the Sun is arranged in large-scale structures of bubble walls, sheets, and filaments of warm gas, within which close to the midplane there are subsheets and filaments of cold dense material; the whole occupies roughly half the available volume and extends with decreasing mean density to at least a kiloparsec off the plane. The remainder of the volume is in bubble interiors, cavities, and tunnels of much lower density, with some but not all of those lower density regions hot enough to be observable via their X-ray emission. This entire system is pervaded by a rather strong and irregular magnetic field and cosmic rays, the pressures of which are confined by the weight of the interstellar gas, particularly that far from the plane where gravity is strong. Observations suggest that the cosmic rays and magnetic field have an even more extended vertical distribution than the warm gas, requiring either the weight of additional coronal material or magnetic tension to confine it to the disk. Adjusting one's perception of this medium to embrace the known aspects is difficult. After this adjustment, there are many problems to solve and prejudices to overcome the weak role of thermal instability, the suppression of certain gravitational instabilities, the problem of determining the state in the low-density regions, the twin difficulties of not having too much OVI (O+5) and getting enough diffuse 3/4 keV X-ray emission, the possible importance of large old-barrel shaped supernova remnants in clarifying matters, the possible role of dust evolution in adjusting the heating to make clouds stable, the factors influencing the magnitudes of the interstellar pressure and scale height things that global models of the medium might examine to clarify some of these matters; attention to these details and more constitute the challenge of this subject.},

The spectra are dominated by warm dust emission, which may be fitted with a single temperature in the range 16-21 K (for v2 emissivity) along each line of sight. Dust heated by the attenuated radiation field in molecular clouds gives rise to intermediate-temperature (10-14 K) emission in the inner Galaxy only. A widespread, very cold component (4-7 K) with optical depth that is spatially correlated with the warm component is also detected. The cold component is unlikely to be due to very cold dust shielded from starlight because it is present at high latitude. We consider hypotheses that the cold component is due to enhanced submillimeter emissivity of the dust that gives rise to the warm component, or that it may be due to very small, large, or fractal particles. Lack of substantial power above the emission from warm dust places strong constraints on the amount of cold gas in the Galaxy. The microwave sky brightness due to interstellar dust is dominated by the cold component, and its angular variation could limit our ability to discern primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.},

Major progress in this field was made primarily in the 1960s, and early 1970s, but since then there has been no comprehensive update on the state of the field. In this review, we discuss the progress in theory, and in particular numerical calculations, which unlike in the 1960s and 1970s, are now commonplace, as well as recent observational developments. We set out the current status for different scenarios for spiral arm formation, the nature of the spiral arms they induce, and the consequences for gas dynamics and star formation in different types of spiral galaxies. We argue that, with possible the exception of barred galaxies, spiral arms are transient, recurrent and initiated by swing amplified instabilities in the disc. We suppose that unbarred m = 2 spiral patterns are induced by tidal interactions, and slowly wind up over time. However the mechanism for generating spiral structure does not appear to have significant consequences for star formation in galaxies.},

We find that these data are best fit by models with non-standard values for vsolar or a net peculiar motion of the high-mass star-forming regions. We argue that a correction to vsolar is much more likely and these data support the conclusion of Binney that Vsolar should be revised upwards from 5.2 to 11kms-1. We find that the values of R0 and v0 that we determine are heavily dependent on the model we use for rotation curve, with model-dependent estimates of R0 ranging from 6.7 +/- 0.5 to 8.9 +/- 0.9kpc, and those of v0 ranging from 200 +/- 20 to 279 +/- 33kms-1.

Detailed abundance analysis reveals that the Galactic disk, halo, and bulge exhibit unique abundance patterns of O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti and neutron-capture elements. These signatures show that environment plays an important role in chemical evolution and that supernovae come in many flavors with a range of element yields. The 300-fold dispersion in heavy element abundances of the most metal-poor stars suggests incomplete mixing of ejecta from individual supernova, with vastly different yields, in clouds of \{approximately\} 10\^{}6 M\{center dot\}. The composition of Orion association stars indicates that star-forming regions are significantly self-enriched on time scales of 80 million years. The rapid self-enrichment and inhomogeneous chemical evolution models are required to match observed abundance trends and the dispersion in the age-metallicity relation.},

abstract = {Accurate characterization of thick disc properties from recent kinematic and photometric surveys provides converging evidences that this intermediate population is a sequel of the violent heating of early disc populations by a merging satellite galaxy. The thick disc population is revisited under the light of new data in a number of galactic sample fields. Various thick disc hypotheses are fitted to observational data through a maximum likelihood technique. The resulting characteristics of the thick disc are the following: a scale height of 760+/-50pc, with a local density of 5.6+/-1\% of the thin disc. The scale length is constrained to be 2.8+/-0.8kpc, well in agreement with the disc scale length (2.5+/-0.3kpc). The mean metallicity of the thick disc is found to be -0.7+/-0.2dex, with no significant metallicity gradients. These photometric constraints in combination with kinematic data give new constraints on the thick disc formation. We show that thick disc characteristics are hardly compatible with a top-down formation scenario but fully compatible with a violent merging event arising at the early thin disc life time as described by Quinn, Hernquist \&amp; Fullagar (1993).},

The algorithm decouples the problem of ``relative'' calibrations from that of ``absolute'' calibrations; the absolute calibration is reduced to determining a few numbers for the entire survey. We pay special attention to the spatial structure of the calibration errors, allowing one to isolate particular error modes in downstream analyses. Applying this to the SDSS imaging data, we achieve \~{}1\% relative calibration errors across 8500 deg2 in griz; the errors are \~{}2\% for the u band. These errors are dominated by unmodeled atmospheric variations at Apache Point Observatory.

Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r\~{}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z\~{}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

The announcement of opportunity (AO) for the data processing will be issued by ESA late in 2006. The Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) has been formed recently and is preparing an answer to this AO. The satellite will downlink around 100 TB of raw telemetry data over a mission duration of 5--6 years. To achieve its required astrometric accuracy of a few tens of microarcseconds, a highly involved processing of this data is required. In addition to the main astrometric instrument Gaia will host a radial-velocity spectrometer and two low-resolution dispersers for multi-color photometry. All instrument modules share a common focal plane consisting of a CCD mosaic about 1 m\^{}2 in size and featuring close to 10\^{}9 pixels. Each of the various instruments requires relatively complex processing while at the same time being interdependent. We describe the composition and structure of the DPAC and the envisaged overall architecture of the system.

abstract = {We have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local Milky Way disc in the CORrelation RAdial VELocities (CORAVEL) and RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) surveys. The CORAVEL survey consists of local dwarf stars (N\"{o}rdstrom et al. Geneva-Copenhagen survey) and local Famaey et al. giant stars. We select RAVE stars with radial velocities that are sensitive to the Galactic vertical space velocity (Galactic latitude b \&lt; -45°). Kuiper statistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the Galactic vertical velocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net vertical flow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with vertically coherent kinematics. In contrast to the `Field of Streams' found in the outer halo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by the CORAVEL dwarfs (complete within \~{}3 × 10-4kpc3), CORAVEL giants (complete within \~{}5 × 10-2kpc3) and RAVE (5-15 per cent complete within \~{}8 kpc3) are devoid of any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. This is sufficiently sensitive to allow our RAVE sample to rule out the passing of the tidal stream of the disrupting Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solar neighbourhood. This agrees with the most-recent determinations of its orbit and dissociates it from the Helmi et al. halo stream. Our constraints on the absence of the Sgr stream near the Sun could prove a useful tool for discriminating between Galactic potential models. The lack of a net vertical flow through the solar neighbourhood in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples argues against the Virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the Sun. There are no vertical streams in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples with stellar densities \&gt;\~{}1.6 × 104 and 1.5 × 103 stars kpc-3, respectively, and therefore no evidence for locally enhanced dark matter.},

abstract = {Whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal or is instead sensitive to environmental conditions is of critical importance: The IMF influences most observable properties of stellar populations and thus galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide deep insights into the star formation process. This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index ($\Gamma$ = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law ($\Gamma$ ˜ 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of “nonstandard” IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

Typically these problem areas arise in fields where the number density of images is high and where the local sky background may vary rapidly. Within such regions the image number density becomes so high that the majority of images overlap, even at relatively high isophotes, and simple image-parameter estimation algorithms become confused. In this paper the potential for a fully automatic method that is both robust and efficient in terms of computer requirements, capable of dealing with complex multiple overlaps, and able to generate the optimum estimates of image parameters is examined. By applying the theory of maximum-likelihood parameter estimation, a coherent strategy is devised which leads to the development of a fully automatic system capable of producing reliable results toward the center of globular clusters and within the dense regions of nearby resolved galaxies.},

(2) The short binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04.

K-band `no-evolution' galaxy-count models are constructed and compared with the observational data. In the infrared, there is no counterpart for the large excess of faint galaxies over the no-evolution model seen in optical counts. In contrast, the K counts require little or no evolution in the luminosity or space density of galaxies, although it is shown that the count predictions can be remarkably insensitive to evolution under certain reasonable assumptions. Finally, model predictions for K-selected redshift surveys are derived.},

Rotational velocities are plotted against chromospheric age to reveal the rotational spin-down trajectories of solar-type stars of various masses. Also, the stellar birthrate, the [Fe/H] ratios, and the peculiar velocities of the sample stars are presented as a function of chromospheric age. The results confirm that a star's rotation depends only on its mass and age. The smooth, continuous decline of both a star's rotation and its activity across the Vaughan-Preston gap is demonstrated. The simples and only remaining tenable interpretation of the gap is that it is caused by time variations in the stellar birthrate.},

In this paper, the constraints available from local data on these two aspects are reviewed, and the interdependence between the SFR, the secular heating of the disc stars, and the shape of the density profile in the z direction is quantified. As a consequence, the validity of exponential density models to represent the vertical structure of the disc is questioned and the uncertainties that affect the IMF derivation from the local LF are reevaluated. We show that under realistic assumptions on the SFR history, the observed local luminosity function gives little support for a bimodal IMF. Comparison of the observed local LF with synthetic LF brings tighter contraints on acceptable SFR and their corresponding IMF between 1 and 3 solar masses. These include decreasing SFR with IMF index x=\~{}1.5, constant SFR with IMF index x=\~{}2.0, or increasing SFR with IMF index x=\~{}2.5.},

abstract = {A detailed model is constructed for the disk and spheroid components of the Galaxy from which the distribution of visible stars and mass in the Galaxy is calculated. The application of star counts to the determination of galactic structure parameters is demonstrated. The possibility of detecting a halo component with the aid of star counts is also investigated quantitatively.  The stellar luminosity functions and scale heights are determined from observations in the solar neighborhood. The global distribution of matter is assumed, based on studies of other galaxies, to be an exponential disk plus a de Vaucouleurs spheroid. The spheroid luminosity function is found to have the same shape as the disk luminosity function over the range of absolute magnitudes (+4 to + 12) that contributes significantly to the star counts for mV ≤ 30. The density of spheroid stars in the solar neighborhood is 1/800 of the value for the disk. The star counts calculated using the density variation of a de Vaucouleurs spheroid are consistent with the available data; the counts predicted with the aid of a Hubble law are inconsistent with observations at more than the two-sigma level of significance.  The variations of the calculated star densities with apparent magnitude, latitude, and longitude agree well with the available star count data for the observationally well studied range of 4 ≲ mV ≲ 22. The calculated (B - V) color distributions are also in good agreement with existing data. The color data also indicate that QSOs comprise only a few percent of the total number of stellar objects to mV = 22 (mB = 22.5). The spheroid component is found to be approximately spherical. The scale lengths of the Galaxy model and computed total luminosity and M/L ratios for the disk and spheroid are in agreement with observations of other Sbc galaxies. Illustrative Fig. and a table of interesting characteristics (such as the mass and luminosity contained within various radii and the escape velocity) are provided.  Further ground-based observations at attainable faint magnitudes (mV ≤ 23 mag) would be important. Star counts and (B - V) colors in several widely separated selected fields would permit a more accurate determination of the disk scale length and the spheroid star density and ellipticity. The most effective regions in which to make these observations are specified.  The Galaxy model of the disk and spheroid is used to predict the star densities (in B and V) that may be observable with the aid of the Space Telescope down to very faint magnitudes. The stellar density to mV = 28 from the disk and spheroid is predicted to be 104 stars per square degree at the galactic pole. The predicted star counts are insensitive to many of the model parameters, although drastic changes in the shape of the luminosity function outside the presently determined magnitude range could produce measurable departures from the predicted star counts at faint magnitudes.  The rotation curve computed solely from the disk and spheroid components decreases beyond about 10 kpc from the center of the Galaxy. A halo with even a relatively small mass density in the Solar neighborhood ($\rho$Halo (Sun) = 0.01 Msun pc-3) can give rise to a flat rotation curve. The stellar content of such a halo would be revealed by observations with Space Telescope cameras if the halo consists of main sequence stars with MV ≲ 19.0 mag (existing observations imply MVMS ≳ 14.0 mag) or faint white dwarfs with MVWD ≲ 17.5 mag (existing observations imply MVWD ≳ 13.0 mag). Existing data imply (M/L)Halo ≳650 (Solar Visual units).  The results for V magnitudes are described in the main text; the corresponding results for B magnitudes are summarized in Appendix A. A table of predicted differential and integrated star counts for both V and B magnitudes is given in Appendix B. Simple formulae that reproduce to an accuracy of 15\% the predicted model star densities as a function of magnitude, latitude, and longitude are also provided in Appendix B.},

Some of Lindblad's ideas on the origin of spiral structure are summarized, particularly those involving spiral density waves. Stability analyses of nearly kinematic waves are outlined, Lin-Shu density waves are investigated, and observations indicating the presence of spiral shock waves in galaxies are noted. An analogy is made between pendula and spiral shocks, and damping of spiral shock waves is examined. Studies of global instabilities of disklike model galaxies are discussed, emphasizing the tendency of such models to form bars, the Ostriker-Peebles stability criterion, and the need for massive galactic halos. Unstable spiral modes are considered along with the production of large fragments in a gas disk by shearing. The possibility that spiral structure could be produced by outside forces (e.g., gravitational distortion by a nearby galaxy) is briefly assessed.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamical evolution of the Galactic globular cluster system in considerably greater detail than has been done hitherto, finding that destruction rates are significantly larger than given by previous estimates. The general scheme (but not the detailed implementation) follows Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker. For the evolution of individual clusters, we use a Fokker-Planck code including the most important physical processes governing the evolution: two-body relaxation, tidal truncation of clusters, compressive gravitational shocks while clusters pass through the Galactic disk, and tidal shocks due to passage close to the bulge. Gravitational shocks are treated comprehensively, using a recent result by Kundi\'{c} \& Ostriker that the <$\Delta$E2> shock-induced relaxation term, driving an additional dispersion of energies, is generally more important than the usual energy shift term <$\Delta$E>. Various functional forms of the correction factor are adopted to allow for the adiabatic conservation of stellar actions in a presence of transient gravitational perturbation. We use a recent compilation of the globular cluster positional and structural parameters, and a collection of radial velocity measurements. Two transverse to the line-of-sight velocity components were assigned randomly according to the two kinematic models for the cluster system (following the method of Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker): one with an isotropic peculiar velocity distribution, corresponding to the present-day cluster population, and the other with the radially preferred peculiar velocities, similar to those of the stellar halo. We use the Ostriker \& Caldwell and the Bahcall, Schmidt, \& Soneira models for our Galaxy. For each cluster in our sample, we calculated its orbits over a Hubble time, starting from the present observed positions and assumed velocities. Medians of the resulting set of peri- and apogalactic distances and velocities are used then as an input for the Fokker-Planck code. Evolution of the cluster is followed up to its total dissolution due to a coherent action of all of the destruction mechanisms. The rate of destruction is then obtained as a median over all the cluster sample, in accord with Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker. We find that the total destruction rate is much larger than that given by Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker with more than half of the present clusters (52\%-58\% for the Ostriker \& Caldwell model, and 75\%-86\% for the Bahcall, Schmidt, \& Soneira model) destroyed in the next Hubble time. Alternatively put, the typical time to destruction is comparable to the typical age, a result that would follow from (but is not required by) an initially power law distribution of destruction times. We discuss some implications for a past history of the globular cluster system and the initial distribution of the destruction times, raising the possibility that the current population is but a very small fraction of the initial population with the remnants of the destroyed clusters constituting presently a large fraction of the spheroid (bulge + halo) stellar population.},

We report on the discovery of companions to 14 OB stars. In total we resolved companions of 41 of 385 O-stars (11\%), 4 of 37 Wolf-Rayet stars (11\%), and 89 of 139 B-stars (64\%; an enriched visual binary sample that we selected for future orbital determinations). We made a statistical analysis of the binary frequency among the subsample that are listed in the Galactic O Star Catalog by compiling published data on other visual companions detected through adaptive optics studies and/or noted in the Washington Double Star Catalog and by collecting published information on radial velocities and spectroscopic binaries. We find that the binary frequency is much higher among O-stars in clusters and associations compared to the numbers for field and runaway O-stars, consistent with predictions for the ejection processes for runaway stars. We present a first orbit for the O-star $\delta$ Orionis; a linear solution of the close, apparently optical, companion of the O-star $\iota$ Orionis; and an improved orbit of the Be star $\delta$ Scorpii. Finally, we list astrometric data for another 249 resolved and 221 unresolved targets that are lower mass stars that we observed for various other science programs.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the disk component of a simulated galaxy formed in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony. At redshift z=0, two distinct dynamical components are easily identified solely on the basis of the orbital parameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating, centrally concentrated spheroid and a disklike component largely supported by rotation. The disk may be further decomposed into a thin, dynamically cold component with stars on nearly circular orbits and a hotter, thicker component with orbital parameters transitional between the thin disk and the spheroid. Supporting evidence for the presence of distinct thick- and thin-disk components is provided, as in the Milky Way, by the double-exponential vertical structure of the disk and in abrupt changes in the vertical velocity distribution as a function of stellar age. The dynamical origin of these components offers intriguing clues to the assembly of spheroids and disks in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies. The spheroid is old and has essentially no stars younger than the time elapsed since the last major accretion event, \~{}8 Gyr ago for the system we consider here. The majority of thin-disk stars, on the other hand, form after the merging activity is over, although a significant fraction (\~{}15\%) of thin-disk stars are old enough to predate the last major merger event. This unexpected population of old-disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satellites whose orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits were circularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. More than half of the stars in the thick disk share this origin, part of a trend that becomes more pronounced with age: 9 out of 10 stars presently in the old (age of \&gt;\~{}10 Gyr) disk component were actually brought into the disk by satellites. By contrast, only one in two stars belonging to the old spheroid are tidal debris; the rest may be traced to a major merger event that dispersed the luminous progenitor at z\~{}1.5 and seeded the formation of the spheroid. Our results highlight the role of satellite accretion events in shaping the disk, as well as the spheroidal, component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly process of a galaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar populations.},

abstract = {Context. This study has been developed in the framework of the computational simulations that are executed for the preparation of the ESA Gaia astrometric mission. Aims: We focus on describing the objects and characteristics that Gaia will potentially observe without taking into consideration instrumental effects (detection efficiency, observing errors). Methods: The theoretical Universe model prepared for the Gaia simulation has been statistically analysed at a given time. Ingredients of the model are described, with the greatest emplasis on the stellar content, the double and multiple stars, and variability. Results: In this simulation the errors have not yet been included. Hence we estimated the number of objects and their theoretical photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic characteristics if they are perfectly detected. We show that Gaia will be able to potentially observe 1.1 billion of stars (single or part of multiple star systems) of which about 2\% are variable stars and 3\% have one or two exoplanets. At the extragalactic level, observations will be potentially composed of several millions of galaxies, half a million to 1 million quasars and about 50 000 supernovae that will occur during the five years of the mission.

abstract = {The inner Milky Way is dominated by a boxy, triaxial bulge which is believed to have formed through disc instability processes. Despite its proximity, its large-scale properties are still not very well known, due to our position in the obscuring Galactic disc. Here, we make a measurement of the three-dimensional density distribution of the Galactic bulge using red clump giants identified in DR1 of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea survey. Our density map covers the inner (2.2 × 1.4 × 1.1) kpc of the bulge/bar. Line-of-sight density distributions are estimated by deconvolving extinction- and completeness-corrected Ks-band magnitude distributions. In constructing our measurement, we assume that the three-dimensional bulge is eightfold mirror triaxially symmetric. In doing so, we measure the angle of the bar-bulge to the line of sight to be (27 ± 2)°, where the dominant error is systematic arising from the details of the deconvolution process. The resulting density distribution shows a highly elongated bar with projected axis ratios ≈(1 : 2.1) for isophotes reaching ˜2 kpc along the major axis. Along the bar axes the density falls off roughly exponentially, with axis ratios (10 : 6.3 : 2.6) and exponential scalelengths (0.70 : 0.44 : 0.18) kpc. From about 400 pc above the Galactic plane, the bulge density distribution displays a prominent X-structure. Overall, the density distribution of the Galactic bulge is characteristic for a strongly boxy/peanut-shaped bulge within a barred galaxy.},

@article{Haywood2013,
abstract = {We analyze a sample of solar neighborhood stars that have high-quality abundance determinations and show that there are two distinct regimes of [$\alpha$/Fe] versus age, which we identify as the epochs of the thick and thin disk formation. A tight correlation between metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable for thick disk stars, implying that this population formed from a well mixed interstellar medium, probably initially in starburst and then more quiescently, over a time scale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars have vertical velocity dispersions which correlate with age, with the youngest objects of this population having small scale heights similar to those of thin disk stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical metallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the youngest thick disk set the initial conditions from which the inner thin disk started to form about 8 Gyr ago, at [Fe/H] in the range of (-0.1, +0.1) dex and [$\alpha$/Fe] \~{} 0.1 dex. This also provides an explanation for the apparent coincidence between the existence of a step in metallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinement of the thick disk within R < 10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk developed outside the influence of the thick disk, giving rise to a separate structure, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of those regions may originate from a primordial pollution of the outer regions by the gas expelled from the forming thick disk. Metal-poor thin disk stars ([Fe/H] < -0.4 dex) in the solar vicinity, whose properties are best explained by them originating in the outer disk, are shown to be as old as the youngest thick disk (9-10 Gyr). This implies that the outer thin disk started to form while the thick disk was still forming stars in the inner parts of the Galaxy. Hence, while the overall inner (thick+thin) disk is comprised of two structures with different scale lengths and whose combination may give the impression of an inside-out formation process, the thin disk itself probably formed its first stars in its outskirts. Moreover, we point out that, given the tight age-metallicity and age-[$\alpha$/Fe] relations that exist in the thick disk, an inside-out process would give rise to a radial gradient in metallicity and $\alpha$-elements in this population, which is not observed. Finally, we argue that our results leave little room for radial migration (in the sense of churning) either to have contaminated the solar vicinity, or, on a larger scale, to have redistributed stars in significant proportion across the solar annulus.},

Adding the m=2 mode accounts for the large asymmetry between the northern and southern warps. We use a Morlet wavelet transform to investigate the spatial and frequency localization of higher frequency modes; these modes are often referred to as ``scalloping.'' We find that the m=10 and 15 scalloping modes are well above the noise, but localized; this suggests that the scalloping does not pervade the whole disk, but only local regions.},

Several database systems are being evaluated to understand how they perform at these data rates, data volumes, and access patterns. This paper describes the LSST requirements, the challenges they impose, the data access philosophy, results to date from evaluating available database technologies against LSST requirements, and the proposed database architecture to meet the data challenges.},

abstract = {Masers found in massive star-forming regions can be located precisely in six-dimensional phase space and therefore serve as a tool for studying Milky Way dynamics. The non-random orbital phases at which the masers are found and the sparseness of current samples require modeling. Here, we model the phase-space distribution function of 18 precisely measured Galactic masers, permitting a mean velocity offset and a general velocity dispersion tensor relative to their local standards of rest, and accounting for different pieces of prior information. With priors only on the Sun's distance from the Galactic Center and on its motion with respect to the local standard of rest, the maser data provide a weak constraint on the circular velocity at the Sun of Vc = 246 ± 30 km s-1. Including prior information on the proper motion of Sgr A* leads to Vc = 244 ± 13 km s-1. We do not confirm the value of Vc ≈ 254 km s-1 found in more restrictive models. This analysis shows that there is no conflict between recent determinations of Vc from Galactic Center analyses, orbital fitting of the GD-1 stellar stream, and the kinematics of Galactic masers; a combined estimate is Vc = 236 ± 11 km s-1. Apart from the dynamical parameters, we find that masers tend to occur at post-apocenter, circular-velocity-lagging phases of their orbits.},

abstract = {The INT/WFC Photometric H-Alpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS) is a 1800 square degrees imaging survey covering Galactic latitudes |b| < 5 deg and longitudes l = 30 to 215 deg in the r, i and H-alpha filters using the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the 2.5-metre Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in La Palma. We present the first quality-controlled and globally-calibrated source catalogue derived from the survey, providing single-epoch photometry for 219 million unique sources across 92\% of the footprint. The observations were carried out between 2003 and 2012 at a median seeing of 1.1 arcsec (sampled at 0.33 arcsec/pixel) and to a mean 5$\backslash$sigma-depth of 21.2 (r), 20.0 (i) and 20.3 (H-alpha) in the Vega magnitude system. We explain the data reduction and quality control procedures, describe and test the global re-calibration, and detail the construction of the new catalogue. We show that the new calibration is accurate to 0.03 mag (rms) and recommend a series of quality criteria to select the most reliable data from the catalogue. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the catalogue's unique (r-Halpha, r-i) diagram to (1) characterise stellar populations and extinction regimes towards different Galactic sightlines and (2) select H-alpha emission-line objects. IPHAS is the first survey to offer comprehensive CCD photometry of point sources across the Galactic Plane at visible wavelengths, providing the much-needed counterpart to recent infrared surveys.},

abstract = {Context. The VISTA Variable Survey (VVV) is able to map the Galaxy at l ≤ 0° with an unpaired depth (at least 3 mag deeper than 2MASS), opening new possibilities for studying the inner structure of the Milky Way.  Aims: In this paper we concentrate on the exploitation of these data to better understand the spatial disposition and distribution of the structures present in the inner Milky Way, particularly the Long Bar and its interaction with the inner disc.  Methods: To attain this, we present the Ks vs. J - Ks diagrams obtained with VVV of regions with (-20° \&lt; l \&lt; -8°, |b| \&lt; 2°). From them we derive the distribution of red clump giants with heliocentric distance as a proxy for the overall stellar structure of the Galaxy. Along with these diagrams, we analysed the distribution of photometrically selected red supergiants, in order to detect events of recent stellar formation.  Results: The observations show the presence of a clear overdensity of stars with associated recent stellar formation that we interpret as the traces of the Long Bar, and we derive an angle for it of 41° ± 5° with the Sun-Galactic centre line, touching the disc near l = 27° and l = -12°. The colour-magnitude diagrams presented here also show a lack of disc stars in several lines of sight, a fact that we associate with the truncation of the disc by the potential of this bar for RGC ≤ 5 kpc.

A subset of these, 67 stars with properties consistent with those of classical Be stars, have been observed at sufficient spectral resolution ($\Delta$$\lambda$ ≈ 2-4 \AA) at blue wavelengths to narrow down their spectral types. We determine these to a precision estimated to be ±1 subtype and then we measure reddenings via spectral energy distribution fitting with reference to appropriate model atmospheres. Corrections for contribution to colour excess from circumstellar discs are made using an established scaling to H$\alpha$ emission equivalent width. Spectroscopic parallaxes are obtained after luminosity class has been constrained via estimates of distances to neighbouring A/F stars with similar reddenings. Overwhelmingly, the stars in the sample are confirmed as luminous classical Be stars at heliocentric distances ranging from 2 kpc up to ˜12 kpc. However, the errors are presently too large to enable the cumulative distribution function with respect to distance to distinguish between models placing the stars exclusively in spiral arms, or in a smooth exponentially declining distribution.},

Distances to stars are determined using a photometric-parallax relation, covering a distance range from \~{}100 pc to 10 kpc over a quarter of the sky at high Galactic latitudes (|b|\&gt;20°). We find that in the region defined by 1 kpc \&lt;Z\&lt; 5 kpc and 3 kpc \&lt;R\&lt; 13 kpc, the rotational velocity for disk stars smoothly decreases, and all three components of the velocity dispersion increase, with distance from the Galactic plane. In contrast, the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars is aligned with a spherical coordinate system and appears to be spatially invariant within the probed volume. The velocity distribution of nearby (Z \&lt; 1 kpc) K/M stars is complex, and cannot be described by a standard Schwarzschild ellipsoid. For stars in a distance-limited subsample of stars (\&lt;100 pc), we detect a multi-modal velocity distribution consistent with that seen by HIPPARCOS. This strong non-Gaussianity significantly affects the measurements of the velocity-ellipsoid tilt and vertex deviation when using the Schwarzschild approximation. We develop and test a simple descriptive model for the overall kinematic behavior that captures these features over most of the probed volume, and can be used to search for substructure in kinematic and metallicity space. We use this model to predict further improvements in kinematic mapping of the Galaxy expected from Gaia and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

abstract = {Using effective temperature and metallicity derived from SDSS spectra for \~{}60,000 F- and G-type main-sequence stars (0.2\&lt;g-r\&lt;0.6), we develop polynomial models for estimating these parameters from the SDSS u-g and g-r colors. These photometric estimates have similar error properties as those determined from SDSS spectra. We apply this method to SDSS photometric data for over 2 million F/G stars and measure the unbiased metallicity distribution for a complete volume-limited sample of stars at distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc. The metallicity distribution can be exquisitely modeled using two components with a spatially varying number ratio, which correspond to disk and halo. The two components also possess the kinematics expected for disk and halo stars. The metallicity of the halo component is spatially invariant, while the median disk metallicity smoothly decreases with distance from the Galactic plane from -0.6 at 500 pc to -0.8 beyond several kiloparsecs. The absence of a correlation between metallicity and kinematics for disk stars is in a conflict with the traditional decomposition in terms of thin and thick disks. We detect coherent substructures in the kinematics-metallicity space, such as the Monoceros stream, which rotates faster than the LSR, and has a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.95, with an rms scatter of only \~{}0.15 dex. We extrapolate our results to the performance expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and estimate that LSST will obtain metallicity measurements accurate to 0.2 dex or better, with proper-motion measurements accurate to \~{}0.5 mas yr-1, for about 200 million F/G dwarf stars within a distance limit of \~{}100 kpc (g\&lt;23.5).},

Now at the end of the second year of the mission, we are in a position to make an initial public release of a portion of this unprecedented data set. This article describes the PS1 Photometric Ladder, Release 12.01. This is the first of a series of data releases to be generated as the survey coverage increases and the data analysis improves. The Photometric Ladder has rungs every hour in right ascension and at four intervals in declination. We will release updates with increased area coverage (more rungs) from the latest data set until the PS1 survey and the final re-reduction are completed. The currently released catalog presents photometry of \~{}1000 objects per square degree in the rungs of the ladder. Saturation occurs at g P1, r P1, i P1 \~{} 13.5; z P1 \~{} 13.0; and y P1 \~{} 12.0. Photometry is provided for stars down to g P1, r P1, i P1 \~{} 19.1 in the AB system. This data release depends on the rigid "Ubercal" photometric calibration using only the photometric nights, with systematic uncertainties of (8.0, 7.0, 9.0, 10.7, 12.4) mmag in (g P1, r P1, i P1, z P1, y P1). Areas covered only with lower quality nights are also included, and have been tied to the Ubercal solution via relative photometry; photometric accuracy of the non-photometric regions is lower and should be used with caution.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the determinations of the positions (pitch angle, shape, numbers, interarm separation) and velocities (rotation curve) of the spiral arms are evaluated and compared to previous determinations. Based on these results, an average cartographic model is developed that fits the means of basic input data and provides predictions for the locations of the arms in the Milky Way, for each galactic quadrant. For each spiral arm segment in each galactic quadrant, the LSR radial velocities are calculated for the radial distance as well as for its galactic longitude. From our velocimetric model, arm intercepts (between line of sights and spiral arms) are indicated in velocity space and may be used to find the distance and velocity to any arm, in a given longitude range. Velocity comparisons between model predictions and published CO velocity distribution are done for each galactic quadrant, with good results. Our velocimetric model is not hydromagnetic in character, nor is it a particle-simulation scheme, yet it is simple to use for comparisons with the observations and it is in symbiosis and consistent with our cartographic model (itself simple to use for comparisons with observations). A blending in velocity of the Perseus and Cygnus arms is further demonstrated, as well as an apparent longitude-velocity blending of the starting points of the four spiral arms near 4 kpc (not a physical ring). An integrated (distance, velocity) model for the mass in the disk is employed, to yield the total mass of 3.0 × 1011 M Sun within a galactic radius of 28 kpc.},

These observations clearly show the large extent of the stellar overdensities on both sides of the Galactic disk, extending between b = -25° and b = +35° and covering over 130° in Galactic longitude. The structure exhibits a complex morphology with both stream-like features and a sharp edge to the structure in both the north and the south. We compare this map to mock observations of two published simulations aimed at explaining such structures in the outer stellar disk, one postulating an origin as a tidal stream and the other demonstrating a scenario where the disk is strongly distorted by the accretion of a satellite. These morphological comparisons of simulations can link formation scenarios to observed structures, such as demonstrating that the distorted-disk model can produce thin density features resembling tidal streams. Although neither model produces perfect agreement with the observations—the tidal stream predicts material at larger distances that is not detected while in the distorted disk model, the midplane is warped to an excessive degree—future tuning of the models to accommodate these latest data may yield better agreement.},

abstract = {We present an investigation into the morphological features of the Milky Way. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way under the effect of a number of different gravitational potentials representing spiral arms and bars, assuming that the Milky Way is a grand design spiral in nature. The gas is subject to ISM cooling and chemistry, enabling us to track the evolution of molecular gas. We use a 3D radiative transfer code to simulate the emission from the SPH output, allowing for the construction of synthetic longitude-velocity (l-v) emission maps as viewed from the Earth. By comparing these maps with the observed emission in CO from the Milky Way, we infer the arm/bar geometry that provides a best fit to our Galaxy. We find that it is possible to reproduce nearly all features of the l-v diagram in CO emission. There is no model, however, that satisfactorily reproduces all of the features simultaneously. Models with two arms cannot reproduce all the observed arm features, while four armed models produce too bright local emission in the inner Galaxy. Our best-fitting models favour a bar pattern speed within 50-60 km s-1 kpc-1 and an arm pattern speed of approximately 20 km s-1 kpc-1, with a bar orientation of approximately 45° and arm pitch angle between 10°-15°.},

abstract = {We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328 Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened "standard" stars. This technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. It also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters, regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings, the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its sightline.},

Located in the constellation of Sagittarius, and on the far side of the Galactic Centre, it has not previously been seen because of the large number of foreground stars (in the Milky Way) in that direction. Following convention, we propose to call it the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Its properties are similar to those of the eight other dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way, and it is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest of them- the Fornax system. The Sagittarius dwarf is elongated towards the plane of the Milky Way, suggesting that it is undergoing some tidal disruption before being absorbed by the Milky Way.},

abstract = {We derive stellar ages, from evolutionary tracks, and metallicities, from Str\"{o}mgren photometry, for a sample of 5828 dwarf and sub-dwarf stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue. This stellar disk sample is used to investigate the age-metallicity diagram in the solar neighbourhood. Such diagrams are often used to derive a so called age-metallicity relation. Because of the size of our sample, we are able to quantify the impact on such diagrams, and derived relations, due to different selection effects. Some of these effects are of a more subtle sort, giving rise to erroneous conclusions. In particular we show that [1] the age-metallicity diagram is well populated at all ages and especially that old, metal-rich stars do exist, [2] the scatter in metallicity at any given age is larger than the observational errors, [3] the exclusion of cooler dwarf stars from an age-metallicity sample preferentially excludes old, metal-rich stars, depleting the upper right-hand corner of the age-metallicity diagram, [4] the distance dependence found in the Edvardsson et al. sample by Garnett \&amp; Kobulnicky is an expected artifact due to the construction of the original sample. We conclude that, although some of it can be attributed to stellar migration in the galactic disk, a large part of the observed scatter is intrinsic to the formation processes of stars.

@article{Juric2008,
abstract = {Using the photometric parallax method we estimate the distances to \~{}48 million stars detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and map their three-dimensional number density distribution in the Galaxy. The currently available data sample the distance range from 100 pc to 20 kpc and cover 6500 deg2 of sky, mostly at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>25). These stellar number density maps allow an investigation of the Galactic structure with no a priori assumptions about the functional form of its components. The data show strong evidence for a Galaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of localized overdensities. The number density distribution of stars as traced by M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (D<2 kpc) is well fit by two exponential disks (the thin and thick disk) with scale heights and lengths, bias corrected for an assumed 35\% binary fraction, of H1=300 pc and L1=2600 pc, and H2=900 pc and L2=3600 pc, and local thick-to-thin disk density normalization $\rho$thick(Rsolar)/$\rho$thin(Rsolar)=12\%. We use the stars near main-sequence turnoff to measure the shape of the Galactic halo. We find a strong preference for oblate halo models, with best-fit axis ratio c/a=0.64, $\rho$H\~{}r-2.8 power-law profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk normalization of 0.5\%. Based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the errors of derived model parameters not to be larger than \~{}20\% for the disk scales and \~{}10\% for the density normalization, with largest contributions to error coming from the uncertainty in calibration of the photometric parallax relation and poorly constrained binary fraction. While generally consistent with the above model, the measured density distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations. In addition to known features, such as the Monoceros stream, we detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at cylindrical galactocentric radii and heights (R,Z)\~{}(6.5,1.5) kpc and (R,Z)\~{}(9.5,0.8) kpc and a remarkable density enhancement in the halo covering over 1000 deg2 of sky toward the constellation of Virgo, at distances of \~{}6-20 kpc. Compared to counts in a region symmetric with respect to the l=0deg line and with the same Galactic latitude, the Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess and may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging with the Milky Way. The u-g color distribution of stars associated with it implies metallicity lower than that of thick disk stars and consistent with the halo metallicity distribution. After removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining data are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidence of further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from \~{}50 pc in the disk to \~{}1-2 kpc in the halo.},

abstract = {We re-examine the age-velocity dispersion relation in the solar neighborhood using improved stellar age estimates which are based on Hipparcos parallaxes and recent stellar evolution calculations. The resulting relation shows that the Milky Way stellar disk was relatively quiescent, suffering little heating or dispersion increase between 3 and 9 Gyr. However, at an age of 9 Gyr there is an abrupt increase in the stellar velocity dispersions. To explain the abrupt increase (by almost a factor of 2) in dispersions we propose that the Milky Way suffered a minor merger 9 Gyr ago that created the thick disk. The quiescent phase is consistent with inefficient heating caused by scattering from tightly wound transient spiral structure.},

The instruments also have a capability for imaging and spectroscopy in the wavelength range 2-180$\mu$m in the pointed observation mode, occasionally inserted into a continuous survey operation. The in-orbit cryogen lifetime is expected to be one and a half years. The All-Sky Survey will cover more than 90\% of the whole sky with a higher spatial resolution and a wider wavelength coverage than that of the previous IRAS all-sky survey. Point-source catalogues of the All-Sky Survey will be released to the astronomical community. Pointed observations will be used for deep surveys of selected sky areas and systematic observations of important astronomical targets. These will become an additional future heritage of this mission.},

abstract = {We are using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy project to measure trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions across the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms. The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16° ± 3°, which favors four rather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances, proper motions, and radial velocities yields complete three-dimensional kinematic information. We find that star-forming regions on average are orbiting the Galaxy ≈15 km s-1 slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center R 0 = 8.4 ± 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed $\Theta$0 = 254 ± 16 km s-1. The ratio $\Theta$0/R 0 can be determined to higher accuracy than either parameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 ± 0.9 km s-1 kpc-1, in good agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of Sgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or slightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally too large, sometimes by factors greater than 2; they can be brought into better agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing $\Theta$0/R 0 from the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km s-1 kpc-1 to a value near 30 km s-1 kpc-1. We offer a "revised" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their uncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates. Finally, our estimates of $\Theta$0 and $\Theta$0/R 0, when coupled with direct estimates of R 0, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is similar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos of these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive.},

Statistics concerning the mass spectrum of the clouds, their size-linewidth relations, and the issue of whether they are gravitationally bound or pressure-supported are addressed.

The interaction of the dark matter halo with the disk and resonances between the orbit of the Clouds and the disk account for the large amplitudes observed for the vertical m=0, 1, and 2 harmonics. The observations lead to six constraints on warp-forcing mechanisms, and our model reasonably approximates all six. The disk is shown to be very dynamic, constantly changing its shape as the Clouds proceed along their orbit. We discuss the challenges to MOND posed by the observations.},

abstract = {The age-metallicity relation for the disk in the neighborhood of the sun is derived from four-color and H-beta photometry of a large sample of southern F dwarfs, analyzed in combination with theoretical isochrones. It is found that the mean metallicity of the disk increased by about a factor of five between 12 and 5 billion years ago and has increased only slightly since then. The star formation rate (SFR) for the disk as a function of time is obtained from the number count data, taking into account stellar evolution and the disk scale height corrections. The SFR which produces a metallicity distribution for the F stars consistent with the G dwarf data is one where the SFR has remained relatively constant over the lifetime of the disk. It is concluded that the disk has collapsed by about a factor of 6 perpendicular to the galactic plane during its lifetime, most of the collapse occurring 13 to 7 billion years ago.},

abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are rich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure and formation history of the Galaxy. As new surveys and instruments adopt similar filter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus, both to inform studies of "normal" main-sequence stars and enable robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. Using a sample of \~{}600,000 point sources detected by SDSS and 2MASS, we tabulate the position and width of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus as a function of g - i color, and provide accurate polynomial fits. We map the Morgan-Keenan spectral type sequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectral standards and by analyzing 3000 SDSS stellar spectra with a custom spectral typing pipeline, described in the Appendix to this paper. We develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimum separation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and use it to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurious SDSS/2MASS matches. Analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliers identifies 370 white-dwarf/M dwarf (WDMD) pairs, 93 QSOs, and 90 M giant/carbon star candidates, and demonstrates that WDMD pairs and QSOs can be distinguished on the basis of their J - Ks and r - z colors. We also identify a group of objects with correlated offsets in the u - g versus g - r and g - r versus r - i color-color spaces, but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects. Future applications of this algorithm to a matched SDSS-UKIDSS catalog may well identify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areas of color-magnitude space.},

abstract = {Deviations of the potentials of stellar systems from integrability cause stars to diffuse through three-dimensional orbit space. The Fokker-Planck equation that describes this diffusion takes a particularly simple form when actions are used as orbit-space coordinates. The rate of diffusion is governed by a vector $\Delta$ and a tensor $\Delta$2, which according to the circumstances of a particular problem should be calculated either from kinetic theory or from Hamiltonian perturbation theory. In many astrophysically interesting circumstances $\Delta$ is related to the divergence of the more readily calculated tensor $\Delta$2. In addition to being computationally handy, this relationship ensures that the orbital diffusion described by the Fokker-Planck equation causes the system's entropy, derived from any H-function, to increase whenever the system is interacting with a hotter system of scatterers. An investigation of the heating of stellar discs in the light of these general results is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {There is still no consensus as to what causes galactic discs to become warped. Successful models should account for the frequent occurrence of warps in quite isolated galaxies, their amplitude as well as the observed azimuthal and vertical distributions of the HI layer. Intergalactic accretion flows and intergalactic magnetic fields may bend the outer parts of spiral galaxies. In this paper we consider the viability of these non-gravitational torques to take the gas off the plane. We show that magnetically generated warps are clearly flawed because they would wrap up into a spiral in less than two or three galactic rotations. The inclusion of any magnetic diffusivity to dilute the wrapping effect causes the amplitude of the warp to damp. We also consider the observational consequences of the accretion of an intergalactic plane-parallel flow at infinity. We have computed the amplitude and warp asymmetry in the accretion model, for a disc embedded in a flattened dark matter halo, including self-consistently the contribution of the modes with azimuthal wavenumbers m= 0 and m= 1. Since the m= 0 component, giving a U-shaped profile, is not negligible compared to the m= 1 component, this model predicts quite asymmetric warps, maximum gas displacements on the two sides in the ratio 3 : 2 for the preferred Galactic parameters, and the presence of a fraction \~{}3.5 per cent of U-shaped warps, at least. The azimuthal dependence of the moment transfer by the ram pressure would produce a strong asymmetry in the thickness of the HI layer and asymmetric density distributions in z, in conflict with observational data for the warp in our Galaxy and in external galaxies. The amount of accretion that is required to explain the Galactic warp would give gas scaleheights in the far outer disc that are too small. We conclude that accretion of a flow with no net angular momentum cannot be the main and only cause of warps.},

So far, high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra have been obtained for over 200 EMP candidates. Here we present the results for the first ˜14 months of this new effort, during which time the photometric candidate selection has been continuously improved. Of the 50 most recently observed EMP candidates, roughly half have [Fe/H] < -3, with 3 stars having [Fe/H] < -3.5. Our analysis shows these metal-poor stars to have typical halo star abundance patterns. These results clearly demonstrate SkyMapper's capability to find large numbers of EMP stars which will vastly improve our understanding of the earliest star formation processes and the onset of chemical evolution.},

abstract = {Exploring the bulge region of our Galaxy is an interesting but challenging quest because of its complex structure and the highly variable extinction. We re-analyse photometric near-infrared data in order to investigate why it is so hard to reach a consensus on the shape and density law of the bulge, as witnessed in the literature. The apparent orientation of the bulge seems to vary with the range of longitude, latitude, and the population considered. To solve the problem we have used the Besan\c{c}on galaxy model to provide a scheme for parameter fitting of the structural characteristics of the bulge region. The fitting process allows the shape of the bulge's main structure to be determined. We explore various parameters and shapes for the bulge population, based on Ferrer's ellipsoids, and fit the shape of the inner disc in the same process. The results show that the main structure has a standard triaxial boxy shape with an orientation of about 13° with respect to the Sun-Galactic centre direction. But the fit is greatly improved when we add a second structure,which is a longer and thicker ellipsoid. We emphasize that our first ellipsoid represents the main boxy bar of the Galaxy and that the thick bulge population could be either (i) a classical bulge slightly flattened by the effect of the bar's potential; or (ii) an inner thick disc counterpart. With Ferrer's ellipsoid, the model shows a general agreement with 2MASS data at the level of 10\% in the whole bulge region but does not produce the "double clump" feature. However, we show that the double clump seen at intermediate latitudes can be reproduced by adding a slight flare to the bar. To characterize the populations better, we further simulate several fields that have been surveyed in spectroscopy and for which a metallicity distribution function (MDF) are available. The model agrees well with these MDF measured along the minor axis if we assume that the main bar has a mean solar metallicity and the second thicker population has a lower metallicity. It then naturally creates a vertical metallicity gradient by mixing the two populations. In the process of model fitting, we also determine the thin disc parameters. The thin disc is found to have a scale length of 2.2 kpc, in good agreement with previous estimates towards the anticentre, but with a large hole of scale length 1.3 kpc, giving a maximum density in the plane for this population at about 2.3 kpc from the Galactic centre. In the very central part of the bulge on top of our two populations, and by subtracting the fitted ellipsoids, we find evidence of an extra population in the nuclear region, at 2° in longitude and 1° of latitude from the Galactic centre. Its location corresponds well to the central molecular zone, and to the Alard nuclear bar.},

@article{Dehnen1998,
abstract = {From the parallaxes and proper motions of a kinematically unbiased subsample of the Hipparcos Catalogue, we have re-determined as a function of colour the kinematics of main-sequence stars. Whereas the radial and vertical components of the mean heliocentric velocity of stars show no trend with colour, the component in the direction of Galactic rotation nicely follows the asymmetric drift relation, except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag. Extrapolating to zero dispersion yields, for the velocity of the Sun with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) in kms\^{}-1, U\_0=10.00+/-0.36 (radially inwards), V\_0=5.25+/-0.62 (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and W\_0=7.17+/-0.38 (vertically upwards). Parenago's discontinuity is beautifully visible in a plot of velocity dispersion against colour: the dispersion, which is essentially constant for late spectral types, decreases towards early spectral types blueward of B-V\~{}0.61mag. We determine the velocity dispersion tensor sigma\^{}2 as function of colour. The mixed moments involving vertical motion are zero within the errors, while sigma\^{}2\_xy is non-zero at about (10kms\^{}-1)\^{}2 independently of colour. The resulting vertex deviations are about 20 deg for early-type stars and 10 deg+/-4 deg for old-disc stars. The persistence of the vertex deviation to late-type stars implies that the Galactic potential is significantly non-axisymmetric at the solar radius. If spiral arms are responsible for the non-axisymmetry, they cannot be tightly wound. Except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag, the ratios of the principal velocity dispersions are given by sigma\_1:sigma\_2:sigma\_3\~{}2.2:1.4:1, while the absolute values increase with colour from sigma\_1\~{}20kms\^{}-1 at B-V=0.2mag to sigma\_1\~{}38kms\^{}-1 at Parenago's discontinuity and beyond. These ratios imply significant heating of the disc by spiral structure and that R\_0/R\_d\~{}=3 to 3.5, where R\_d is the scalelength of the disc.},

abstract = {Context. Chemically inhomogeneous populations are observed in most globular clusters, but not in open clusters. Cluster mass seems to play a key role in the existence of multiple populations.  Aims: Studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters is needed to better understand the mechanism of their formation and determine the mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple populations. Here we studied NGC 6705, which is a young and massive open cluster located towards the inner region of the Milky Way. This cluster is located inside the solar circle. This makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient.  Methods: This study makes use of BVI and ri photometry and comparisons with theoretical isochrones to derive the age of NGC 6705. We study the density profile of the cluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. Based on abundances of the chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of the red clump stars. Radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internal kinematics of the cluster.  Results: The estimated ages range from 250 to 316 Myr, depending on the adopted stellar model. Luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of mass segregation. We derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function and from the kinematics, finding values between 3700 M⊙ and 11 000 M⊙. After selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities, we obtain a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.10 ± 0.06 based on 21 candidate members. Moreover, NGC 6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations or anti-correlations between Al, Mg, Si, and Na, which are expected in multiple populations. This is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lower than the required mass limit proposed in the literature to develop multiple populations.

@article{Chiba2000,
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the space motions of 1203 solar-neighborhood stars with metal abundances [Fe/H]<=-0.6, on the basis of a catalog, of metal-poor stars selected without kinematic bias recently revised and supplemented by Beers et al. This sample, having available proper motions, radial velocities, and distance estimates for stars with a wide range of metal abundances, is by far the largest such catalog to be assembled to date. We show that the stars in our sample with [Fe/H]<=-2.2, which likely represent a ``pure'' halo component, are characterized by a radially elongated velocity ellipsoid ($\sigma$U,$\sigma$V,$\sigma$W)=(141+/-11, 106+/-9, 94+/-8) km s-1 and small prograde rotation <V$\phi$>=30 to 50 km s-1, consistent with previous analysis of this sample by Beers and Sommer-Larsen based on radial velocity information alone. In contrast to the previous analysis, we find a decrease in <V$\phi$> with increasing distance from the Galactic plane for stars that are likely to be members of the halo population ($\Delta$<V$\phi$>/$\Delta$|Z|=-52+/-6 km s-1 kpc-1), which may represent the signature of a dissipatively formed flattened inner halo. Unlike essentially all previous kinematically selected catalogs, the metal-poor stars in our sample exhibit a diverse distribution of orbital eccentricities, e, with no apparent correlation between [Fe/H] and e. This demonstrates, clearly and convincingly, that the evidence offered in 1962 by Eggen, Lynden-Bell, \& Sandage for a rapid collapse of the Galaxy, an apparent correlation between the orbital eccentricity of halo stars with metallicity, is basically the result of their proper-motion selection bias. However, even in our nonkinematically selected sample, we have identified a small concentration of high-e stars at [Fe/H]\~{}-1.7, which may originate, in part, from infalling gas during the early formation of the Galaxy. We find no evidence for an additional thick disk component for stellar abundances [Fe/H]<=-2.2. The kinematics of the intermediate-abundance stars close to the Galactic plane are, in part, affected by the presence of a rapidly rotating thick disk component with <V$\phi$> \~{}=200 km s-1 (with a vertical velocity gradient on the order of $\Delta$<V$\phi$>/$\Delta$|Z|=-30+/-3 km s-1 kpc-1) and velocity ellipsoid ($\sigma$U, $\sigma$V, $\sigma$W)=(46+/-4, 50+/-4, 35+/-3) km s-1. The fraction of low-metallicity stars in the solar neighborhood that are members of the thick disk population is estimated as \~{}10\% for -2.2<[Fe/H]<=-1.7 and \~{}30\% for -1.7<[Fe/H]<=-1. We obtain an estimate of the radial scale length of the metal-weak thick disk of 4.5+/-0.6 kpc. We also analyze the global kinematics of the stars constituting the halo component of the Galaxy. The outer part of the halo, which we take to be represented by local stars on orbits reaching more than 5 kpc from the Galactic plane, exhibits no systematic rotation. In particular, we show that previous suggestions of the presence of a ``counter-rotating high halo'' are not supported by our analysis. The density distribution of the outer halo is nearly spherical and exhibits a power-law profile that is accurately described as $\rho$\~{}R-3.55+/-0.13. The inner part of the halo is characterized by a prograde rotation and a highly flattened density distribution. We find no distinct boundary between the inner and outer halo. We confirm the clumping in angular-momentum phase space of a small number of local metal-poor stars noted in 1999 by Helmi et al. We also identify an additional elongated feature in angular-momentum phase space extending from the clump to regions with high azimuthal rotation. The number of members in the detected clump is not significantly increased from that reported by Helmi et al., even though the total number of the sample stars we consider is almost triple that of the previous investigation. We conclude that the fraction of halo stars that may have arisen from the precursor object of this clump may be smaller than 10\% of the present Galactic halo, as previously suggested. The implications of our results for the formation of the Galaxy are discussed, in particular in the context of the currently favored cold dark matter theory of hierarchical galaxy formation.},

This assumption is built into decades of modeling of the evolution of stellar populations in our own Galaxy and in external systems.

We investigate the implications of such migrations for observed stellar populations. Radial migration provides an explanation for the observed flatness and spread in the age-metallicity relation and the relative lack of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood.

abstract = {The local stellar kinematics of the Milky Way offer a useful tool for studying the rotation curve of the Galaxy. These kinematics - usually parametrized by the Oort constants AB - depend on the local gradient of the rotation curve as well as its absolute value (Theta\_0), and the Sun's distance to the Galactic Centre (R\_0). The density of interstellar gas in the Milky Way is shown to vary non-monotonically with radius, and so contributes significantly to the local gradient of the rotation curve. We have therefore calculated mass models for the Milky Way that include this component, and have derived the corresponding radial variation in the Oort constants. Between 0.9R\_0and 1.2R\_0the Oort functionsA(R) and B(R) differ significantly from the general \~{}Theta\_0/R dependence. Various previously inexplicable observations are shown to be consistent with these new predictions. For example, these models may explain the \~{}40 per cent difference between the values for 2AR\_0 derived from radial velocity data originating in the inner and outer Galaxy. They also go some way toward explaining the different shapes of the velocity ellipsoids of giant and dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood. However, a consistent picture only emerges if one adopts small values for the radius of the solar circle (R\_0= 7.1 +/-0.4 kpc) and local circular speed (Theta\_0=184+/-8 kms\^{}-1). With these Galactic constants the rotation curve of the Milky Way declines slowly in the outer Galaxy; V\_rot(20 kpc) = 166 kms\^{}-1. Our low value for the distance to the Galactic Centre agrees well with the only direct determination of R\_0(7.2+/-0.7 kpc). Using these Galactic constants, we also find that the proper motion of Sgr A\^{}* is consistent with the observational constraints. Simple analytic arguments as well as detailed calculations show that the radial velocities and proper motions of our best-fitting model are entirely consistent with the radial velocities of Cepheids and the Hipparcos measurements of their proper motions.},

Our investigation is based on direct numerical integration of initially circular test-particle orbits in the sheared sheet. We confirm the conclusion of other investigators that heating by spiral structure can explain the principal features of the age-velocity dispersion relation and other parameters of the velocity distribution in the solar neighbourhood. In addition, we find that heating by strong transient spirals can naturally explain the presence of small-scale structure in the velocity distribution (`moving groups'). Heating by spiral structure also explains why the stars in a single velocity-space moving group have a wide range of ages, a result that is difficult to understand in the traditional model in which these structures result from inhomogeneous star formation. Thus we suggest that old moving groups arise from irregularities in the Galactic potential rather than from irregularities in the star formation rate.},

abstract = {We present two models for the interstellar extinction in the Galaxy that are based on the hypothesis that the interstellar dust is well mixed with the gas, with a constant ratio (except for a small dependence of metallicity on the Galactic radius), and therefore that the extinction is proportional to the column density of the gas. In the first model we assume that the Galaxy is axisymmetric; the gas density in the disk is a function of the Galactic radius and of the distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane, and the extinction is proportional to the column density of the gas. In the second model we take into account the spiral structure of the Galaxy. In this case, instead of increasing almost linearly with distance, the extinction increases by steps each time a spiral arm is crossed, but only increases slowly in the interarm regions. The gas density distribution is obtained from the Berkeley and Parkes H I surveys and from the Columbia University CO survey. The IRAS 100 $\mu$m brightness distribution is also used as a tracer of the interstellar dust column density. The predictions of the models are compared with data taken from a number of catalogs that present color excess and distances for large samples of stars. Our models are useful for estimating distances of objects and color corrections for objects for which the distance can be estimated by some other method, and also for star counts and brightness models of the Galaxy, among other applications.},

abstract = {Context. The Milky Way bulge is the nearest galactic bulge and the most readily accessible laboratory for studies of stellar populations in spheroids based on individual stellar abundances and kinematics. These studies are challenged by the strongly variable and often large extinction on a small spatial scale.  Aims: We use the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) ESO public survey data to measure extinction values in the complete area of the Galactic bulge covered by the survey at high resolution.  Methods: We derive reddening values using the method described in Paper I. This is based on measuring the mean (J - Ks) color of red clump giants in small subfields of 2' × 2' to 6' × 6' in the following bulge area: - 10.3° ≤ b ≤ + 5.1° and - 10.0° ≤ l ≤ + 10.4°. To determine the reddening values E(J - Ks) for each region, we measure the RC color and compare it to the (J - Ks) color of RC stars measured in Baade's Window, for which we adopt E(B - V) = 0.55. This allows us to construct a reddening map sensitive to small-scale variations minimizing the problems arising from differential extinction.  Results: The significant reddening variations are clearly observed on spatial scales as small as 2'. We find good agreement between our extinction measurements and Schlegel maps in the outer bulge, but, as already stated in the literature the Schlegel maps are unreliable for regions within |b| ≲ 6°. In the inner regions, we compare our results with maps derived from DENIS and Spitzer surveys. While we find good agreement with other studies in the corresponding overlapping regions, our extinction map is of higher quality owing to both its higher resolution and a more complete spatial coverage of the bulge. We investigate the importance of differential reddening and demonstrate the need for high spatial resolution extinction maps for detailed studies of bulge stellar populations and structure.  Conclusions: We present the first extinction map covering uniformly \~{}315 sq. deg. of the Milky Way bulge at high spatial resolution. We consider a 30 arcmin window at a latitude of b = -4°, which corresponds to a frequently studied low extinction window, the so-called Baade's Window, and find that its AKs values can vary by up to 0.1 mag. Larger extinction variations are observed at lower Galactic latitudes. The extinction variations on scales of up to 2'-6' must be taken into account when analyzing the stellar populations of the Galactic bulge.

These data can be binned up to map extinction in three dimensions across the northern Galactic Plane. The large size of the IPHAS database (\$\backslash sim 200\$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digital photometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude (\$r' \backslash sim 20\$) allow extinction to be mapped with fine angular (\$ \backslash sim 10 \$ arcmin) and distance (\$\backslash sim 0.1\$ \~{}kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the Solar Circle. High reddening within the Solar Circle on occasion brings this range down to \$\backslash sim 2\$ kpc. The resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatly exceeds that of previous empirical 3D extinction maps, enabling the structure of the Galactic Plane to be studied in increased detail. \{$\backslash$scshape mead\} accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors, unresolved ISM substructure, and binarity. The impact of metallicity variations, within the range typical of the Galactic disc is small. The accuracy and reliability of \{$\backslash$scshape mead\} are tested through the use of simulated photometry created with Monte-Carlo sampling techniques. The success of this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results are compared to the literature.},

From this the corrections to the disk surface densities and mass-to-light ratios which are inferred from observed vertical distributions and velocity dispersions of old disk stars and H I are derived. On this basis the best value for the old disk M/L is derived as 6±2 M\_sun;/L\_sun;,B.

All fields were chosen to have uniform star densities and galaxies visible in or very near the fields. More stars are seen in all four warp fields compared to the four control directions, and the excesses are unlikely to be caused solely by the sun's position north of midplane. One warp-control field pair appear to have very similar reddening versus distance behavior, and simple subtraction of the control field from the warp field reveals a well-defined main sequence and perhaps a turnoff for the outer stellar disk. In the absence of detailed reddening and metallicity estimates, we cannot yet estimate the distances and ages of the outer disk stars.},

abstract = {The Planck and Herschel missions are currently measuring the far-infrared to millimeter emission of dust, which combined with existing IR data, will for the first time provide the full spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galactic interstellar medium dust emission, from the mid-IR to the mm range, with an unprecedented sensitivity and down to spatial scales \~{}30”. Such a global SED will allow a systematic study of the dust evolution processes (e.g. grain growth or fragmentation) that directly affect the SED because they redistribute the dust mass among the observed grain sizes. The dust SED is also affected by variations of the radiation field intensity. Here we present a versatile numerical tool, DustEM, that predicts the emission and extinction of dust grains given their size distribution and their optical and thermal properties. In order to model dust evolution, DustEM has been designed to deal with a variety of grain types, structures and size distributions and to be able to easily include new dust physics. We use DustEM to model the dust SED and extinction in the diffuse interstellar medium at high-galactic latitude (DHGL), a natural reference SED that will allow us to study dust evolution. We present a coherent set of observations for the DHGL SED, which has been obtained by correlating the IR and HI-21 cm data. The dust components in our DHGL model are (i) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; (ii) amorphous carbon and (iii) amorphous silicates. We use amorphous carbon dust, rather than graphite, because it better explains the observed high abundances of gas-phase carbon in shocked regions of the interstellar medium. Using the DustEM model, we illustrate how, in the optically thin limit, the IRAS/Planck HFI (and likewise Spitzer/Herschel for smaller spatial scales) photometric band ratios of the dust SED can disentangle the influence of the exciting radiation field intensity and constrain the abundance of small grains (a ⪉ 10 nm) relative to the larger grains. We also discuss the contributions of the different grain populations to the IRAS, Planck (and similarly to Herschel) channels. Such information is required to enable a study of the evolution of dust as well as to systematically extract the dust thermal emission from CMB data and to analyze the emission in the Planck polarized channels. The DustEM code described in this paper is publically available.},

abstract = {We present a new investigation of the influence of unresolved binaries on the form deduced for the stellar luminosity function from photometric parallax surveys. We have compiled a catalogue of photometry and binary statistics for stars known to be north of -30° declination and within 8 parsecs of the Sun, and have used these stars as a reference sample for our multiplicity analysis. M-dwarfs comprise almost eighty percent of the sample. The overall multiplicity fraction amongst the 106 systems (and 151 stars) in this sample is only 35\%. Transforming the local luminosity function to a mass function, we find relatively good agreement amongst most of the currently-available mass-luminosity relations. The mass function is best-represented as a power-law, $\Psi$(M)∝M-1.05 for masses between 1 and 0.10 Msun, with a steeper slope at higher masses and a sharp decline in numbers below 0.1 Msun. While incompleteness in the 8-parsec sample may contribute to some extent to the decrease in number density at the lowest masses, the 5.2-parsec sample shows the same behavior, suggesting that the mass function turns over before reaching the hydrogen-burning limit. We have combined images taken with the Planetary Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope with previously-obtained wide-field Schmidt plate data to search for wide (\&gt;10 a.u. separation) binaries amongst a sample of mid-type M-dwarfs which have been employed in photometric parallax analyses of the stellar luminosity function. Six of the 41 stars observed are binary, while a further two are triple with the number of resolved companions expected from moving the local sample to a comparable distance. We have determined the mass-ratio distribution for the nearby-star sample, and find that it is incompatible with the hypothesis of both components being drawn independently from the same power-law mass function. Rather, there is clear evidence for preferred formation (or survival) of systems with components of nearly equal mass. We also find no strong evidence for a correlation between mass-ratio and the orbital semi-major axis. Based on these results, we have constructed starcount models to investigate how unresolved binary systems influence the form of the luminosity function derived using photometric parallax methods. Our conclusion is that the results are only weakly dependent on the binary fraction, and that low-mass binaries cannot bring these photometric studies into agreement with the luminosity function derived by counting the nearest stars. However, previous photometric analyses have failed to take into account the change in the slope in the (Mv, V-I) relation at (V-I) ˜2.9 magnitudes- close to the peak in the luminosity function. Once the data are analyzed using a more appropriate color-magnitude relation, we find (statistically) good agreement between the local luminosity function and the results of the photometric parallax analyses of more distant stars.},

abstract = {The suggestion by Zaritsky \&amp; Lin (ZL) that a vertical extension of the red clump feature (the VRC) in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the Large Magellanic Cloud is consistent with a significant population of foreground stars to the LMC that could account for the observed microlensing optical depth has been challenged by various investigators. We respond by (1) examining each of the challenges presented, to determine whether any or all of those arguments invalidate the claims made by ZL, and (2) presenting new photometric and spectroscopic data obtained in an attempt to resolve this issue. We systematically discuss why the objections raised so far do not unequivocally refute ZL's claim. We conclude that although the CMD data do not mandate the existence of a foreground population, they are entirely consistent with a foreground population associated with the LMC that contributes significantly (\~{}50\%) to the observed microlensing optical depth. From our new data, we conclude that \&lt;\~{}40\% of the VRC stars are young, massive red clump stars, because (1) synthetic CMDs created using the star formation history derived independently from Hubble Space Telescope data suggest that fewer than 50\% of the VRC stars are young, massive red clump stars, (2) the angular distribution of the VRC stars is more uniform than that of the young (\&lt;1 Gyr) main-sequence stars, and (3) the velocity dispersion of the VRC stars in the region of the LMC examined by ZL, 18.4+/-2.8 km s\^{}-1 (95\% confidence limits), is inconsistent with the expectation for a young disk population. Each of these arguments is predicated on assumptions, and the conclusions are uncertain. Therefore, an exact determination of the contribution to the microlensing optical depth by the various hypothesized foreground populations, and the subsequent conclusions regarding the existence of halo MACHOs, requires a detailed knowledge of many complex astrophysical issues, such as the initial mass function, star formation history, and post-main-sequence stellar evolution.},

abstract = {We have compiled a new sample of 240 halo objects with accurate distance and radial velocity measurements, including globular clusters, satellite galaxies, field blue horizontal branch (FHB) stars and red giant stars from the Spaghetti survey. The new data lead to a significant increase in the number of known objects for Galactocentric radii beyond 50 kpc, which allows a reliable determination of the radial velocity dispersion profile out to very large distances. The radial velocity dispersion shows an almost constant value of 120 km s-1 out to 30 kpc and then continuously declines down to 50 km s-1 at about 120 kpc. This fall-off puts important constraints on the density profile and total mass of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. For a constant velocity anisotropy, the isothermal profile is ruled out, while both a dark halo following a truncated flat (TF) model of mass 1.2+1.8-0.5× 1012Msolar and a Navarro, Frenk \&amp; White (NFW) profile of mass 0.8+1.2-0.2× 1012Msolar and c= 18 are consistent with the data. The significant increase in the number of tracers combined with the large extent of the region probed by these has allowed a more precise determination of the Milky Way mass in comparison to previous works. We also show how different assumptions for the velocity anisotropy affect the performance of the mass models.},

The photometry provides a detailed census of the red clump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermost field. Through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z = 1 changes from 71 ± 9\% in the innermost field to 16 ± 6\% in the outermost field. The disk shows a clear trend of increasing scale length with time, evolving from rs = 1.0 ± 0.1 kpc 10 Gyr ago to rs = 1.8 ± 0.1 at times more recent than 5 Gyr ago, in agreement with analytical predictions for disk growth. Beyond the disk truncation radius, however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradient reverses, in agreement with recent simulations. The late and slow growth of the stellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of M33.},

The entire survey procedure, from the raw Schmidt plate data to the final white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF), is described, with special emphasis on completeness concerns. We obtain a sample of 58 WDs, for which we have follow-up CCD photometry and spectroscopy of a representative subsample. Effective temperatures and luminosities of our sample objects are determined by comparing photometry with the model atmosphere predictions of Bergeron, Saumon \&amp; Wesemael. Space densities are calculated using an adaptation of Schmidt's (1/Vmax) method, from which a WDLF is constructed. Comparison of our observational LF with the models of both Wood and Garc\'{\i}a-Berro et al. indicates an age for the local Galatic disc of 10-1+3 Gyr. Importantly, we find no evidence of incompleteness in our survey sample. Proper motion number counts imply the survey is complete, and the WD sample passes the (V/Vmax) completeness test.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the analysis of 3-colour (IJK\_s\_) near infrared star counts obtained during the commissioning phase of the Deep Near Infrared Southern Sky Survey (DENIS) project. Observing methods, data processing, source extraction and calibration are briefly outlined. Nine strips of 12' of RA x 30° in declination crossing the galactic plane at different longitudes ranging from 217° to 385°, covering approximately 50 square degrees are analyzed. One strip has been measured in 3 colours, the others in J and K\_s\_ only. More than 250 000 objects are detected and calibrated. The completeness limits are 17.5, 15.5 and 13.5 in the I, J and K\_s\_ bands, respectively. Colour-colour diagrams are shown to be efficient tool for breaking out dwarf and giant star populations especially at low latitude, where the interstellar extinction strongly affects the far away red giants. Source counts are compared to the SKY model developed by Wainscoat et al. (1992ApJS...83..111W).

Three AAO 150arcsec plates were scanned by the Automatic Plate Measuring System (APM) at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, and 20825 images were counted by its associated software. Previously known features of rich globular clusters which appear in the raw counts include a flattening of the luminosity function below MB ≡ +5.2, increased central concentration of bright stars relative to faint ones (normally interpreted as mass segregation), and mild deviations in radial profile from King models. Crowding of the field, which causes the counting procedure to miss faint stars preferentially near the cluster center, contributes to all of these, and may be responsible for all of the apparent mass segregation, but not for all of the other two effects.},

abstract = {Models of the chemical evolution of our Galaxy are extended to include radial migration of stars and flow of gas through the disc. The models track the production of both iron and $\alpha$-elements. A model is chosen that provides an excellent fit to the metallicity distribution of stars in the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS) of the solar neighbourhood and a good fit to the local Hess diagram. The model provides a good fit to the distribution of GCS stars in the age-metallicity plane, although this plane was not used in the fitting process. Although this model's star formation rate is monotonically declining, its disc naturally splits into an $\alpha$-enhanced thick disc and a normal thin disc. In particular, the model's distribution of stars in the ([O/Fe], [Fe/H]) plane resembles that of Galactic stars in displaying a ridge line for each disc. The thin-disc's ridge line is entirely due to stellar migration, and there is the characteristic variation of stellar angular momentum along it that has been noted by Haywood in survey data. Radial mixing of stellar populations with high $\sigma$z from inner regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood provides a natural explanation of why measurements yield a steeper increase of $\sigma$z with age than predicted by theory. The metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium is predicted to be steeper than in earlier models, but appears to be in good agreement with data for both our Galaxy and external galaxies. The models are inconsistent with a cut-off in the star formation rate at low gas surface densities. The absolute magnitude of the disc is given as a function of time in several photometric bands, and radial colour profiles are plotted for representative times.},

abstract = {Aims.In this paper we derive the structure of the Galactic stellar warp and flare. Methods: .We use 2MASS red clump and red giant stars, selected at mean and fixed heliocentric distances of Rȯ≃3, 7 and 17 kpc. Results: .Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) a clear stellar warp signature is derived for the 3 selected rings, proving that the warp starts already within the solar circle; (ii) the derived stellar warp is consistent (both in amplitude and phase-angle) with that for the Galactic interstellar dust and neutral atomic hydrogen; (iii) the consistency and regularity of the stellar-gaseous warp is traced out to about R\_GC˜20 kpc; (iv) the Sun seems not to fall on the line of nodes. The stellar warp phase-angle orientation ($\phi$˜15°) is close to the orientation angle of the Galactic bar and this, most importantly, produces an asymmetric warp for the inner Rȯ≃3 and 7 kpc rings; (v) a Northern/Southern warp symmetry is observed only for the ring at Rȯ≃17 kpc, at which the dependency on $\phi$ is weakened; (vi) treating a mixture of thin and thick disk stellar populations, we trace the variation with R\_GC of the disk thickness (flaring) and derive an almost constant scale-height (\~{}0.65 kpc) within R\_GC˜15 kpc. Further out, the disk flaring increase gradually reaching a mean scale-height of \~{}1.5 kpc at R\_GC˜23 kpc; (vii) the derived outer disk warping and flaring provide further robust evidence that there is no disk radial truncation at R\_GC˜14 kpc. Conclusions: .In the particular case of the Canis Major (CMa) over-density we confirm its coincidence with the Southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l˜240° (for Rȯ≃7 kpc) which brings down the Milky Way mid-plane by \~{}3° in this direction. The regularity and consistency of the stellar, gaseous and dust warp argues strongly against a recent merger scenario for Canis Major. We present evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density, radial velocities, proper motion etc) of CMa are consistent with it being a normal Milky Way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for more complex interpretations of its origin. The present analysis or outer disk structure does not provide a conclusive test of the structure or origin of the Monoceros Ring. Nevertheless, we show that a warped flared Milky Way contributes significantly at the locations of the Monoceros Ring. Comparison of outer Milky Way H I and CO properties with those of other galaxies favors the suggestion that complex structures close to planar in outer disks are common, and are a natural aspect of warped and flaring disks.},

abstract = {Using Hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions together with radial velocity complementary data (Coravel for late type stars and new ground-based data for early type stars) for several thousand B-F type stars, the velocity ellipsoid has been determined as a function of age. The variations with age of the ratio of the velocity dispersions, of the vertex deviation and the age-velocity dispersion relation (AVR) have been estimated. Our results confirm that mixing is not complete at about 0.8 - 1 Gyr. The shape of the velocity ellipsoid changes with time, getting rounder from sigma\_U/sigma\_V/sigma\_W = 1/0.63/0.42 +/- 0.04 at about 1 Gyr to 1/0.7/0.62 +/- 0.04 at 4 - 5 Gyr. The AVR rises to a maximum, thereafter remaining roughly constant; there is no dynamically significant evolution of the disk after about 4 - 5 Gyr. The velocity dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane saturates at about 15 - 17 km/s for thin disk stars. The vertex deviation declines with age and remains near zero after 5 Gyr.},

abstract = {Context: This paper is part of our ongoing study of star formation in the (far-) outer Galaxy. Aims: Our goal in this paper is to study stars and molecular gas in the direction of IRAS 06145+1455 (WB89-789). The kinematic distance of the associated molecular cloud is 11.9 kpc. With a galactocentric distance of \~{} 20.2 kpc, this object is at the edge of the (molecular) disk of the Galaxy. Methods: We use near-IR (J, H, K), molecular line-, and dust continuum observations. Results: The near-IR data show the presence of an (embedded) cluster of about 60 stars, with a radius ˜ 1.3 pc and an average stellar surface density \~{} 12 pc-2. We find at least 14 stars with NIR-excess, 3 of which are possibly Class I objects. The cluster is embedded in a ˜ 1000 M⊙ molecular/dust core, from which a molecular outflow originates. The temperature of most of the outflowing gas is ⪉ 40 K, and the total mass of the swept-up material is ⪉ 10 M⊙. Near the center of the flow, indications of much higher temperatures are found, probably due to shocks. A spectrum taken of one of the probable cluster members shows a tentative likeness to that of a K3 III-star (with an age of at least 20 Myr). If correct, this would confirm the kinematic distance. Conclusions: .This cluster is the furthest one from the Galactic center yet detected. The combination of old and recent activity implies that star formation has been going on for at least 20 Myr, which is difficult to understand considering the location of this object, where external triggers are either absent or weak, compared to the inner Galaxy. This suggests that once star formation is occurring, later generations of stars may form through the effect of the first generation of stars on the (remnants of) the original molecular cloud. Partly based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile. Table 4 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

Even the most optimistic simulations of imaging data show that position errors can become severe (on the order of the beam size) at flux levels at which images contain 1/50 to 1/15 sources per beam, depending on the slope of the number-flux relation dlogN/dlogS. These problems are expected to be significant for recent observations of faint submillimeter sources and may be the reason that some sources appear to lack optical counterparts.},

Such data set strong constraints on the radial structure of the disk. At the forefront of this 'drilling' program, very deep CCD frames probe the most external parts of the disk. Over the whole effective magnitude range (18-25), all contributions in the statistics which should be expected from old disk stars beyond 6 kpc vanish, although such stars dominate by far at distances less than 5 kpc. This is the signature of a sharp cutoff in the star density: the edge of the Galactic disk between 5.5 and 6 kpc. As a consequence, the Galactic radius does not exceed 14 kpc (assuming solar radius = 8.5). Colors of elliptical galaxies measured in the field rule out the risk of being misled by undetected extinction.},

abstract = {Between the early 40s, when Baade showed the first evidence for the existence of two distinct stellar populations, and today, with our Galaxy surprising us with new substructures discovered almost on a monthly basis, it is clear that a remarkable progress has been achieved in our understanding of the Galaxy, of its structure and stellar populations, and of its chemical and dynamical signatures. Yet, some questions have remained open and have proven to be very challenging. The main task of this Working Group has been to review the state-of-the-art knowledge of the Milky Way galaxy, to identify the future challenges, and to propose which tools (in terms of facilities, infrastructures, instruments, science policies) would be needed to successfully tackle and solve the remaining open questions. Considering the leadership position that Europe has reached in the field of Galactic astronomy (thanks to the Hipparcos mission and the Very Large Telescope) and looking at the (near-) future major initiatives it has undertaken (VISTA and VST survey telescopes, Gaia mission), this work clearly has been very timely. It is of uttermost importance for European astronomy to keep and further consolidate its leading position. This Working Group has made recommendations that would allow dissecting our backyard laboratory, the Galaxy, even further. ESO survey telescopes about to become operational and the upcoming ESA Gaia mission are a guarantee for opening new horizons and making new discoveries. We, the astronomers, with the support of our funding agencies, are ready to fully commit to the best exploitation of the treasure that is ahead of us. The main recommendations this Working Group has made to ESA and ESO are to guarantee the expected tremendous capabilities of these new facilities, to vigourously organise their synergies and to jointly give ways to European astronomers to be leaders in the exploitation of their output data.},

abstract = {We report on 75 mas resolution, near-IR imaging spectroscopy within the central 30 lt-days of the Galactic center, taken with the new adaptive optics-assisted integral-field spectrometer SINFONI on the ESO VLT. To a limiting magnitude of K\~{}16, 9 of 10 stars in the central 0.4", and 13 of 17 stars out to 0.7" from the central black hole have spectral properties of B0-B9 main-sequence stars. Based on the 2.1127 $\mu$m He I line width, all brighter early-type stars have normal rotation velocities, similar to solar neighborhood stars. We combine the new radial velocities with SHARP/NACO astrometry to derive improved three-dimensional stellar orbits for six of these ``S stars'' in the central 0.5". Their orientations in space appear random. Their orbital planes are not co-aligned with those of the two disks of massive young stars 1"-10" from Sgr A*. We can thus exclude the hypothesis that the S stars as a group inhabit the inner regions of these disks. They also cannot have been located/formed in these disks and then migrated inward within their planes. From the combination of their normal rotation and random orbital orientations, we conclude that the S stars were most likely brought into the central light-month by strong individual scattering events. The updated estimate of distance to the Galactic center from the S2 orbit fit is R0=7.62+/-0.32 kpc, resulting in a central mass value of (3.61+/-0.32)×106 Msolar. We happened to catch two smaller flaring events from Sgr A* during our spectral observations. The 1.7-2.45 $\mu$m spectral energy distributions of these flares are fit by a featureless, ``red'' power law of spectral index $\alpha$'=-4+/-1 (S$\nu$\~{}$\nu$$\alpha$'). The observed spectral slope is in good agreement with synchrotron models in which the infrared emission comes from accelerated, nonthermal, high-energy electrons in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow in the central R\~{}10RS region.

abstract = {The presence of dust in the interstellar medium of galaxies dramatically affects their spectral appearance, and the interpretation of their underlying physical properties. Consequently, the diagnostic of galaxy spectra depends crucially on our understanding of the nature and properties of these dust particles. Models of interstellar dust particles must be able to reproduce a basic set of observational constraints, including the general interstellar extinction and infrared emission observed in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Recent analysis of the solar spectrum have resulted in a convergence between the solar and B star abundances. This development, and the steadiness in the solar abundance determination of the primary refractory elements Mg, Si, and Fe, strongly suggest that any viable dust model must also obey interstellar abundances constraints. Fifteen dust models that differ in composition and size distribution and that simultaneously satisfy the local extinction, infrared emission, and abundances constraints have been shown to exist. This multitude of viable dust models provides us with an increased flexibility in understanding dust evolution and the many variations in dust properties in different phases of the ISM and stellar environments. The evolution of stars, the primary sources of dust, and the general ISM, in which the dust is processed, change the abundance of dust as a function of time. In particular, the delayed injection of dust from low mass stars, which are the primary sources of carbon dust, into the ISM gives rise to a changing silicate-to-carbon dust mass ratio, which will affect the UV-visual extinction in galaxies. If PAHs are only produced in AGB stars, the delayed injection of these molecules into the ISM may be in part responsible for the absence of PAH features in young star forming regions, or for the existence of a metallicity threshold below which PAHs have not yet formed. On a cosmological scale, an epoch of rapid and efficient dust formation is needed to account for the presence of dust-enshrouded star forming regions at high redshift. We show that the first opacity is probably produce by SN-condensed carbon dust that formed in less than \~{} 100 Myr after the onset of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We present bright galaxy number counts in five broad bands (u', g', r', i', z') from imaging data taken during the commissioning phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The counts are derived from two independent stripes of imaging scans along the celestial equator, one each toward the northern and the southern Galactic cap, covering about 230 and 210 deg2, respectively. A careful study is made to verify the reliability of the photometric catalog. For galaxies brighter than r*=16, the catalog produced by automated software is examined against eye inspection of all objects. Statistically meaningful results on the galaxy counts are obtained in the magnitude range 12<=r*<=21, using a sample of 900,000 galaxies. The counts from the two stripes differ by about 30\% at magnitudes brighter than r*=15.5, consistent with a local 2 $\sigma$ fluctuation due to large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution. The shape of the number counts-magnitude relation brighter than r*=16 is well characterized by N\~{}100.6m, the relation expected for a homogeneous galaxy distribution in a ``Euclidean'' universe. In the magnitude range 16<r*<21, the galaxy counts from both stripes agree very well and follow the prediction of the no-evolution model, although the data do not exclude a small amount of evolution. We use empirically determined color transformations to derive the galaxy number counts in the B and I814 bands. We compute the luminosity density of the universe at zero redshift in the five SDSS bands and in the B band. We find LB=2.4+/-0.4×108 Lsolar h Mpc-3, for a reasonably wide range of parameters of the Schechter luminosity function in the B band.

Because of the low optical depth at 240 $\mu$m, the FIR emission traces the distribution of Galactic dust in the Galaxy. We model the dust distribution as due to three components: a warped exponential disk with scale length 0.28 Rsolar and a flaring scale height, a spiral arm component with four arms as traced by Galactic H II regions, and the local (Orion) arm, which produces prominent emission features at Galactic longitudes l\~{}=80 and -100°. A cosmic infrared background of 1.07 MJy sr-1 is recovered, consistent with previous determinations. The dust distribution is then used to calculate absorption in J and K, and the stellar emission in these wavebands is modeled with two components: a warped exponential disk with a scale length of 0.28 Rsolar and a spiral arm component dominated by two arms. This small scale length is consistent with a maximal disk model for our Galaxy, which is inconsistent with the cuspy dark matter halos predicted in CDM models. We find different amplitudes for the warp in the stars and dust, which starts within the solar circle.},

abstract = {From the Sun's location in the Galactic disk, different arm tracers (CO, H I, hot dust, etc.) have been employed to locate a tangent to each spiral arm. Using all various and different observed spiral arm tracers (as published elsewhere), we embark on a new goal, namely the statistical analysis of these published data (data mining) to statistically compute the mean location of each spiral arm tracer. We show for a typical arm cross-cut, a separation of 400 pc between the mid-arm and the dust lane (at the inner edge of the arm, toward the Galactic center). Are some arms major and others minor? Separating arms into two sets, as suggested by some, we find the same arm widths between the two sets. Our interpretation is that we live in a multiple (four-arm) spiral (logarithmic) pattern (around a pitch angle of 12°) for the stars and gas in the Milky Way, with a sizable interarm separation (around 3 kpc) at the Sun's location and the same arm width for each arm (near 400 pc from mid-arm to dust lane).},

@article{Lopez-Corredoira2002,
abstract = {We have pursued two different methods to analyze the old stellar population near the Galactic plane, using data from the 2MASS survey. The first method is based on the isolation of the red clump giant population in the color-magnitude diagrams and the inversion of its star counts to obtain directly the density distribution along the line of sight. The second method fits the parameters of a disc model to the star counts in 820 regions. Results from both independent methods are consistent with each other. The qualitative conclusions are that the disc is well fitted by an exponential distribution in both the galactocentric distance and height. There is not an abrupt cut-off in the stellar disc (at least within R<15 kpc). There is a strong flare (i.e. an increase of scale-height towards the outer Galaxy) which begins well inside the solar circle, and hence there is a decrease of the scale-height towards the inner Galaxy. Another notable feature is the existence of a warp in the old stellar population whose amplitude is coincident with the amplitude of the gas warp. It is shown for low latitude stars (mean height: |z| \~{} 300 pc) in the outer disc (galactocentric radius R> 6 kpc) that: the scale-height in the solar circle is hz(Rsun)=3.6x 10-2 Rsun, the scale-length of the surface density is hR=0.42 Rsun and the scale-length of the space density in the plane (i.e. including the effect of the flare) is H=0.25 Rsun. The variation of the scale-height due to the flare follows roughly a law hz(R)\~{} hz(Rsun) exp (R-Rsun)/([12-0.6R(kpc)] kpc) (for R<\~{} 15 kpc; Rsun=7.9 kpc). The warp moves the mean position of the disc to a height zw=1.2x 10-3 R(kpc)5.25sin (phi +5o ) pc (for R<\~{} 13 kpc; Rsun=7.9 kpc).},

While the total number counts are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of the current standard models, we find striking discrepancies between the observed and predicted color distributions at Faint (V greater than 20) magnitudes: the previously defined 'standard' model predicts too many halo stars and too few disk stars. Indeed, our observations show that disk stars are the majority population to at least V = 21. We have investigated the possible sources of these discrepancies using star-count models and present an interim model which better fits the available data.},

abstract = {Based on O-B stars, an optical counterpart of the large-scale warp of the H I gas layer in our Galaxy is investigated, from the point of view that the proper motion in galactic latitude of these stars enables the detection of the kinematic behaviour of the warp. The plane defined by the O-B stars concerned here appears to be inclined about 3° to the galactic plane outside the solar circle (R0 = 8.5 kpc), in a similar fashion to the H I layer. A selected set of the proper motions of about 350 O-B stars within 3 kpc from the sun is analyzed on the proper motion systems of N 30, FK4, and FK5. A remarkable difference in the kinematic behaviours of the warp appears between the old systems (N30 and FK4) and FK5-system. The results on the FK5-system show no meaningful systematic z-motion, even though the O-B star plane exterior to the solar circle is inclined. These kinematic behaviours of the warp can neither be inferred from the model of the oblique material flow nor from the concepts of the precessional stellar rings and of the bending oscillation of a stellar disk.},

abstract = {We report new L and T dwarfs found in a cross-match of the SDSS Data Release 1 and 2MASS. Our simultaneous search of the two databases effectively allows us to relax the criteria for object detection in either survey and to explore the combined databases to a greater completeness level. We find two new T dwarfs in addition to the 13 already known in the SDSS DR1 footprint. We also identify 22 new candidate and bona fide L dwarfs, including a new young L2 dwarf and a peculiar potentially metal-poor L2 dwarf with unusually blue near-IR colors. These discoveries underscore the utility of simultaneous database cross-correlation in searching for rare objects. Our cross-match completes the census of T dwarfs within the joint SDSS and 2MASS flux limits to the \~{}97\% level. Hence, we are able to accurately infer the space density of T dwarfs. We employ Monte Carlo tools to simulate the observed population of SDSS DR1 T dwarfs with 2MASS counterparts and find that the space density of T0-T8 dwarf systems is 0.0070+0.0032-0.0030 pc-3 (95\% confidence interval), i.e., about one per 140 pc3. Compared to predictions for the T dwarf space density that depend on various assumptions for the substellar mass function, this result is most consistent with models that assume a flat substellar mass function dN/dM\~{}M0.0. No \&gt;T8 dwarfs were discovered in the present cross-match, although less than one was expected in the limited area (2099 deg2) of SDSS DR1.},

abstract = {Context. AKARI is the first Japanese astronomical satellite dedicated to infrared astronomy. One of the main purposes of AKARI is the all-sky survey performed with six infrared bands between 9 $\mu$m and 200 $\mu$m during the period from 2006 May 6 to 2007 August 28. In this paper, we present the mid-infrared part (9 $\mu$m and 18 $\mu$m bands) of the survey carried out with one of the on-board instruments, the infrared camera (IRC).  Aims: We present unprecedented observational results of the 9 $\mu$m and 18 $\mu$m AKARI all-sky survey and detail the operation and data processing leading to the point source detection and measurements.  Methods: The raw data are processed to produce small images for every scan, and the point sources candidates are derived above the 5$\sigma$ noise level per single scan. The celestial coordinates and fluxes of the events are determined statistically and the reliability of their detections is secured through multiple detections of the same source within milli-seconds, hours, and months from each other.  Results: The sky coverage is more than 90\% for both bands. A total of 877 091 sources (851 189 for 9 $\mu$m, 195 893 for 18 $\mu$m) are confirmed and included in the current release of the point source catalog. The detection limit for point sources is 50 mJy and 90 mJy for the 9 $\mu$m and 18 $\mu$m bands, respectively. The position accuracy is estimated to be better than 2''. Uncertainties in the in-flight absolute flux calibration are estimated to be 3\% for the 9 $\mu$m band and 4\% for the 18 $\mu$m band. The coordinates and fluxes of detected sources in this survey are also compared with those of the IRAS survey and are found to be statistically consistent.

Using the morphologies of WR nebulae known to be composed of stellar ejecta as a guide, we constructed ejecta nebula criteria similar to those of Chu and searched for likely WR ejecta nebulae in the Southern H$\alpha$ Survey (SHS). A new WR ejecta nebula around WR 8 is found and its morphology is discussed. The fraction of WR stars with ejecta-type nebulae is roughly consistent between the Milky Way (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) at around 5-6 per cent, with the MW sample dominated by nitrogen-rich WR central stars (WN type) and the LMC stars having a higher proportion of carbon-rich WR central stars (WC type). We compare our results with those of previous surveys, including those of Marston and Miller \&amp; Chu, and find broad consistency. We investigate several trends in the sample: most of the clear examples of ejecta nebulae have WNh central stars, and very few ejecta nebulae have binary central stars. Finally, the possibly unique evolutionary status of the nebula around the binary star WR 71 is explored.},

This galaxy has been magnified by a factor of 22× by a massive, X-ray luminous galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 at z = 0.544. Using the Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics aided integral field spectrograph OSIRIS on KECK II, we target the H$\alpha$ emission and achieve a spatial resolution of 0farcs1, corresponding to a source-plane resolution of 170 pc. The galaxy has well-developed spiral arms and the nebular emission line dynamics clearly indicate a rotationally supported disk with V rot/$\sigma$ \~{} 4. The best-fit disk velocity field model yields a maximum rotation of V rotsin i = 150 ± 15 km s-1, and a dynamical mass of M dyn = (1.3 ± 0.2) × 1010 cosec2(i) M sun (within 2.5 kpc), where the inclination angle i = 45° ± 10°. Based on the [N II] and H$\alpha$ ratios, we measured the radial chemical abundance gradient from the inner hundreds of parsecs out to \~{}5 kpc. The slope of the gradient is -0.16 ± 0.02 dex kpc-1, significantly steeper than the gradient of late-type or early-type galaxies in the local universe.

abstract = {Aims: The scientific community needs to be prepared to analyse the data from Gaia, one of the most ambitious ESA space missions, which is to be launched in 2012. The purpose of this paper is to provide data and tools to predict how Gaia photometry is expected to be. To do so, we provide relationships among colours involving Gaia magnitudes (white light G, blue GBP, red GRP and GRVS bands) and colours from other commonly used photometric systems (Johnson-Cousins, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Hipparcos and Tycho). Methods: The most up-to-date information from industrial partners has been used to define the nominal passbands, and based on the BaSeL3.1 stellar spectral energy distribution library, relationships were obtained for stars with different reddening values, ranges of temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities. Results: The transformations involving Gaia and Johnson-Cousins V - IC and Sloan DSS g - z colours have the lowest residuals. A polynomial expression for the relation between the effective temperature and the colour GBP - GRP was derived for stars with Teff ≥ 4500 K. For stars with Teff < 4500 K, dispersions exist in gravity and metallicity for each absorption value in g - r and r - i. Transformations involving two Johnson or two Sloan DSS colours yield lower residuals than using only one colour. We also computed several ratios of total-to-selective absorption including absorption AG in the G band and colour excess E(GBP - GRP) for our sample stars. A relationship involving AG/AV and the intrinsic (V - IC) colour is provided. The derived Gaia passbands have been used to compute tracks and isochrones using the Padova and BASTI models. Finally, the performances of the predicted Gaia magnitudes have been estimated according to the magnitude and the celestial coordinates of the star. Conclusions: The provided dependencies among colours can be used for planning scientific exploitation of Gaia data, performing simulations of the Gaia-like sky, planning ground-based complementary observations and for building catalogues with auxiliary data for the Gaia data processing and validation.

abstract = {Different stellar sub-populations of the Milky Way's stellar disk are known to have different vertical scale heights, their thickness increasing with age. Using SEGUE spectroscopic survey data, we have recently shown that mono-abundance sub-populations, defined in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] space, are well described by single-exponential spatial-density profiles in both the radial and the vertical direction; therefore, any star of a given abundance is clearly associated with a sub-population of scale height hz . Here, we work out how to determine the stellar surface-mass density contributions at the solar radius R 0 of each such sub-population, accounting for the survey selection function, and for the fraction of the stellar population mass that is reflected in the spectroscopic target stars given populations of different abundances and their presumed age distributions. Taken together, this enables us to derive $\backslash$Sigma \_\{R\_0\}(h\_z), the surface-mass contributions of stellar populations with scale height hz . Surprisingly, we find no hint of a thin-thick disk bi-modality in this mass-weighted scale-height distribution, but a smoothly decreasing function, approximately $\backslash$Sigma \_\{R\_0\}(h\_z)$\backslash$propto $\backslash$exp (-h\_z), from hz ≈ 200 pc to hz ≈ 1 kpc. As hz is ultimately the structurally defining property of a thin or thick disk, this shows clearly that the Milky Way has a continuous and monotonic distribution of disk thicknesses: there is no "thick disk" sensibly characterized as a distinct component. We discuss how our result is consistent with evidence for seeming bi-modality in purely geometric disk decompositions or chemical abundances analyses. We constrain the total visible stellar surface-mass density at the solar radius to be $\backslash$Sigma \^{}\{\^{}*\}\_\{R\_0\} = 30 +/- 1$\backslash$ M\_$\backslash$odot pc-2.},

abstract = {Context. The distribution of various interstellar gas components and the pressure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a result of the interplay of different dynamical mechanisms and energy sources on the gas in the Milky Way. The scale heights of the different gas tracers, such as H i and CO, are a measure of these processes. The scale height of [C ii] emission in the Galactic plane is important for understanding those ISM components not traced by CO or H i.  Aims: We determine the average distribution of [C ii] perpendicular to the plane in the inner Galactic disk and compare it to the distributions of other key gas tracers, such as CO and H i.  Methods: We calculated the vertical, z, distribution of [C ii] in the inner Galactic disk by adopting a model for the emission that combines the latitudinal, b, spectrally unresolved BICE survey, with the spectrally resolved Herschel Galactic plane survey of [C ii] at b = 0°. Our model assumed a Gaussian emissivity distribution vertical to the plane, and related the distribution in z to that of the latitude b using the spectrally resolved [C ii] Herschel survey as the boundary solution for the emissivity at b = 0°.  Results: We find that the distribution of [C ii] perpendicular to the plane has a full-width half-maximum of 172 pc, larger than that of CO, which averages \~{}110 pc in the inner Galaxy, but smaller than that of H i, \~{}230 pc, and is offset by - 28 pc.  Conclusions: We explain the difference in distributions of [C ii], CO, and H i as due to [C ii] tracing a mix of ISM components. Models of hydrostatic equilibrium of clouds in the disk predict different scale heights, for the same interstellar pressure. The diffuse molecular clouds with [C ii] but no CO emission likely have a scale height intermediate between the low density atomic hydrogen H i clouds and the dense CO molecular clouds.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

The 4MOST design is especially intended to complement three key all-sky, space-based observatories of prime European interest: Gaia, eROSITA and Euclid. Initial design and performance estimates for the wide-field corrector concepts are presented. Two fibre positioner concepts are being considered for 4MOST. The first one is a Phi-Theta system similar to ones used on existing and planned facilities. The second one is a new R-Theta concept with large patrol area. Both positioner concepts effectively address the issues of fibre focus and pupil pointing. The 4MOST spectrographs are fixed configuration two-arm spectrographs, with dedicated spectrographs for the high- and low-resolution fibres. A full facility simulator is being developed to guide trade-off decisions regarding the optimal field-of-view, number of fibres needed, and the relative fraction of high-to-low resolution fibres. The simulator takes mock catalogues with template spectra from Design Reference Surveys as starting point, calculates the output spectra based on a throughput simulator, assigns targets to fibres based on the capabilities of the fibre positioner designs, and calculates the required survey time by tiling the fields on the sky. The 4MOST consortium aims to deliver the full 4MOST facility by the end of 2018 and start delivering high-level data products for both consortium and ESO community targets a year later with yearly increments.},

Observations of CO (J = 1→0) emission at over 2500 positions between l = -4° and 170° are interpreted to determine the distribution of molecules at galactic radius, R, from 0 to 16 kpc. The radial distribution of CO surface brightness ICO, exhibits a sharp maximum in the central 1.5 kpc, a minimum at R = 1.5 - 3.5 kpc, and a ring peaking at 6 kpc. Between 6 and 15 kpc, ICO falls by two orders of magnitude, while 21 cm measurements show virtually constant H I surface density. The conversion of ICO to H2 mass is discussed. All empirical measures of this conversion factor agree to better than a factor of 2. The H2 density and surface density are presented as a function of R and z out to R = 16 kpc and compared with the H I densities. The total surface density of interstellar gas (H2 + H I) as function of R is derived from these data. In particular, a detailed discussion of the distribution of interstellar gas in the galactic center region is presented.},

abstract = {Aims: We aim at a detailed description of the kinematic properties of the old, (several Gyrs) late-type CO-absorption star population among the Galactic centre (GC) cluster stars. This cluster is composed of a central supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) and a self-gravitating system of stars. Understanding its kinematics thus offers the opportunity to understand the dynamical interaction between a central point mass and the surrounding stars in general, especially in view of understanding other galactic nuclei.  Methods: We applied AO-assisted, near-infrared imaging and integral-field spectroscopy using the instruments NAOS/CONICA and SINFONI at the VLT. We obtained proper motions for 5445 stars, 3D velocities for 664 stars, and acceleration limits (in the sky plane) for 750 stars. Global kinematic properties were analysed using velocity and velocity dispersion distributions, phase-space maps, two-point correlation functions, and the Jeans equation.  Results: We detect for the first time significant cluster rotation in the sense of the general Galactic rotation in proper motions. Out of the 3D velocity dispersion, we derive an improved statistical parallax for the GC of R0 = 8.07 ± 0.32\_stat ± 0.13\_sys kpc. The distribution of 3D stellar speeds can be approximated by local Maxwellian distributions. Kinematic modelling provides deprojected 3D kinematic parameters, including the mass profile of the cluster. We find an upper limit of 4\% for the amplitude of fluctuations in the phase-space distribution of the cluster stars compared to a uniform, spherical model cluster. Using upper limits on accelerations, we constrain the minimum line-of-sight distances from the plane of Sgr A* of five stars located within the innermost few (projected) arcsec. The stars within 0.7'' radius from the star group IRS13E do not co-move with this group, making it unlikely that IRS13E is the core of a substantial star cluster. Overall, the GC late-type cluster is described well as a uniform, isotropic, rotating, dynamically relaxed, phase-mixed system.

We find that the distribution of orbital eccentricities is predicted to be different for each model: a prominent peak at low eccentricity is expected for the heating, migration and gas-rich merging scenarios, while the eccentricity distribution is broader and shifted towards higher values for the accretion model. These differences can be traced back to whether the bulk of the stars in each case is formed in situ or is accreted, and is robust to the peculiarities of each model. A simple test based on the eccentricity distribution of nearby thick-disc stars may thus help elucidate the dominant formation mechanism of the Galactic thick disc.},

The technique is based on the simultaneous utilization of star counts and colors. These two techniques provide independent estimations of the extinction, and each method reacts differently to foreground star contamination and to star clustering. We take advantage of both methods to build a large-scale extinction map (2.5d×2.5d) of the North America and Pelican Nebulae complex. With Ks star counts and H-Ks color analysis the visual extinction is mapped up to 35 mag. Regions with visual extinction greater than 20 mag account for less than 3\% of the total mass of the cloud. Color is generally a better estimator for the extinction than star counts. Nine star clusters are identified in the area, seven of which were previously unknown.},

abstract = {High-quality Hipparcos data for a complete sample of nearly 12000 main-sequence and subgiant stars, together with Padua isochrones, are used to constrain the star formation history of the solar neigbourhood and the processes that stochastically accelerate disc stars. The velocity dispersion of a coeval group of stars is found to increase with time from \~{}8kms-1 at birth as t0.33. In the fits, the slope of the initial mass function (IMF) near 1Msolar proves to be degenerate with the rate at which the star formation rate declines. If the slope of the IMF is to lie near Salpeter's value, -2.35, the star formation rate has to be very nearly constant. The age of the solar neighbourhood is found to be 11.2+/-0.75Gyr with remarkably little sensitivity to variations in the assumed metallicity distribution of old disc stars. This age is only a gigayear younger than the age of the oldest globular clusters when the same isochrones and distance scale are employed. It is compatible with current indications of the redshift of luminous galaxy formation only if there is a large cosmological constant. A younger age is formally excluded because it provides a poor fit to the number density of red stars. Since this density is subject to a significantly uncertain selection function, ages as low as 9Gyr are plausible even though they lie outside our formal error bars.},

We compare this distribution with those obtained in four simulations of galaxy formation taken from the literature as compiled by Sales et al. Each simulation emphasizes different scenarios for the origin of such stars (satellite accretion, heating of a pre-existing thin disc during a merger, radial migration, and gas-rich mergers). We find that the observed distribution peaks at low eccentricities and falls off smoothly and rather steeply to high eccentricities. This finding is fairly robust to changes in distances and to plausible assumptions about thin-disc contamination. Our results favour models where the majority of stars formed in the Galaxy itself on orbits of modest eccentricity and disfavour the pure satellite accretion case. A gas-rich merger origin where most of the stars form 'in situ' appears to be the most consistent with our data.},

abstract = {The formation of thick stellar disks in spiral galaxies is studied. Simulations of gas-rich young galaxies show formation of internal clumps by gravitational instabilities, clump coalescence into a bulge, and disk thickening by strong stellar scattering. The bulge and thick disks of modern galaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make thick disks too, but there is an important difference. Thick disks made by internal processes have a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but thick disks made by mergers flare. The difference arises because in the first case, perpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to the disk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of this density. In the case of mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the column density and the low-density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring is inconsistent with observations. Late-stage gas accretion and thin-disk growth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks formed by internal evolution. These results reinforce the idea that disk galaxies accrete most of their mass smoothly and acquire their structure by internal processes, in particular through turbulent and clumpy phases at high redshift.},

These are identified as the Sagittarius-Carina Arm (the major arm or arm No. 1), the Scutum-Crux Arm (the intermediate arm or arm No. 2), the Norma Arm (the internal arm or arm No. 1'), and the Perseus Arm (the external arm or arm No. 2'). It is concluded that the morphological type of the Galaxy is much closer to Sc than to Sb.},

abstract = {An expression is derived for changes induced in the phase-space distribution function when a galactic disk's dynamical structure is changed by fluctuations in its gravitational potential field. The changes are found to be second-order in the perturbing potential, and of the form of a diffusion in phase space. This result is evaluated for the case of a model transient spiral. The radial velocity dispersion of the stars increases in response to a steady sequence of perturbations as t to the 1/2-power for low velocity stars, declining to t to the 1/5-power as the radial excursions of stars become large by comparison with the spirals' spatial wavelength. The present predictions are in agreement with the age/velocity dispersion relation observed in N-body experiments. It is concluded that recurrent transient spirals naturally account for the velocity-dispersion relation observed for the solar neighborhood stars.},

In 2001 June, the SDSS released to the general astronomical community its early data release, roughly 462 deg2 of imaging data including almost 14 million detected objects and 54,008 follow-up spectra. The imaging data were collected in drift-scan mode in five bandpasses (u, g, r, i, and z); our 95\% completeness limits for stars are 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5, respectively. The photometric calibration is reproducible to 5\%, 3\%, 3\%, 3\%, and 5\%, respectively. The spectra are flux- and wavelength-calibrated, with 4096 pixels from 3800 to 9200 \AA at R\~{}1800. We present the means by which these data are distributed to the astronomical community, descriptions of the hardware used to obtain the data, the software used for processing the data, the measured quantities for each observed object, and an overview of the properties of this data set.},

abstract = {Many galaxies at high redshift have peculiar morphologies dominated by 108-109 Msolar kpc-sized clumps. Using numerical simulations, we show that these ``clump clusters'' can result from fragmentation in gravitationally unstable primordial disks. They appear as ``chain galaxies'' when observed edge-on. In less than 1 Gyr, clump formation, migration, disruption, and interaction with the disk cause these systems to evolve from initially uniform disks into regular spiral galaxies with an exponential or double-exponential disk profile and a central bulge. The inner exponential is the initial disk size, and the outer exponential is from material flung out by spiral arms and clump torques. A nuclear black hole may form at the same time as the bulge from smaller black holes that grow inside the dense cores of each clump. The properties and lifetimes of the clumps in our models are consistent with observations of the clumps in high-redshift galaxies, and the stellar motions in our models are consistent with the observed velocity dispersions and lack of organized rotation in chain galaxies. We suggest that violently unstable disks are the first step in spiral galaxy formation. The associated starburst activity gives a short timescale for the initial stellar disk to form.},

@article{Lallement2014,
abstract = {Aims: Three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Galactic interstellar matter (ISM) are a potential tool of wide use, but accurate and detailed maps are still lacking. One of the ways to construct the maps is to invert individual distance-limited ISM measurements, a method we have applied here to measurements of stellar color excess in the optical. Methods: We assembled color excess data together with the associated parallax or photometric distances to constitute a catalog of ≃23 000 sightlines for stars within 2.5 kpc. The photometric data are taken from Str\"{o}mgren catalogs, the Geneva photometric database, and the Geneva-Copenhagen survey. We also included extinctions derived towards open clusters. We applied an inversion method based on a regularized Bayesian approach to this color excess dataset, a method previously used for mapping at closer distances. Results: We show the dust spatial distribution resulting from the inversion by means of planar cuts through the differential opacity 3D distribution, and by means of 2D maps of the integrated opacity from the Sun up to various distances. The mapping assigns locations to the nearby dense clouds and represents their distribution at the spatial resolution that is allowed by the dataset properties, i.e. ≃10 pc close to the Sun and increasing to ≃100 pc beyond 1 kpc. Biases toward nearby and/or weakly extincted stars make this dataset particularly appropriate to mapping the local and neighboring cavities and to locating faint, extended nearby clouds, which are both goals that are difficult or impossible with other mapping methods. The new maps reveal a ≃1 kpc wide empty region in the third quadrant in the continuation of the so-called CMa tunnel of the Local Cavity, a cavity that we identify as the Superbubble GSH238+00+09 detected in radio emission maps and that is found to be bounded by the Orion and Vela clouds. The maps also show an extended narrower tunnel in the opposite direction (l ≃ 70°) that also extends the Local Bubble further and together with it forms a conspicuous cavity bounded by the main Lup, Sco, Oph, Aql, Lac, Cep, and Tau clouds and OB associations. This chain of cavities and surrounding dense regions constitute the first computed representation of the well known Gould belt/Lindblad ring structures. Finally, almost all off-plane faint features that appear in 2D dust maps have a counterpart in the 3D maps, providing the dust distribution in nearby tenuous clouds.

The corona and bulge parameters are adjusted until the potential produces an acceptable rotation curve. The density laws obtained can be translated in terms of star count predictions. The authors obtain a dynamical mass density in the solar neighbourhood in the range 0.09 to 0.12 M\_sun; pc-3. This value is well compatible with published estimations of the observed local mass. It is found that the local missing mass, if any, does not exceed 0.03 M\_sun; pc-3. The best fit is obtained for an unseen mass disc with 0.01 M\_sun; pc-3 density and 600 pc scale height. A flattening of the dark corona would produce the same effect.},

abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven-year sky survey which began in 2005 May. UKIDSS is being carried out using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has the largest \'{e}tendue of any infrared astronomical instrument to date. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000deg2 to a depth of K \~{} 18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35deg2 to K \~{} 21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77deg2 to K \~{} 23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long-term astronomical legacy data base; the design is, however, driven by a series of specific goals - for example, to find the nearest and faintest substellar objects, to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist, to determine the substellar mass function, to break the z = 7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionization, to measure the growth of structure from z = 3 to the present day, to determine the epoch of spheroid formation, and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed. Images and catalogues are being made available through a fully queryable user interface - the WFCAM Science Archive (http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). The data are being released in stages. The data are immediately public to astronomers in all ESO member states, and available to the world after 18 months. Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortia collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release, we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

abstract = {We use the Gaussian fit results of Paper I to investigate the properties of interstellar H I in the solar neighborhood. The warm and cold neutral media (WNM and CNM) are physically distinct components. The CNM spin temperature histogram peaks at about 40 K; its median, weighted by column density, is 70 K. About 60\% of all H I is WNM; there is no discernible change in this fraction at z=0. At z=0, we derive a volume filling fraction of about 0.50 for the WNM; this value is very rough. The upper limit WNM temperatures determined from line width range upward from \~{}500 K; a minimum of about 48\% of the WNM lies in the thermally unstable region 500-5000 K. The WNM is a prominent constituent of the interstellar medium, and its properties depend on many factors, requiring global models that include all relevant energy sources, of which there are many. We use principal components analysis, together with a form of least-squares fitting that accounts for errors in both the independent and dependent parameters, to discuss the relationships among the four CNM Gaussian parameters. The spin temperature Ts and column density N(H I) are, approximately, the two most important eigenvectors; as such, they are sufficient, convenient, and physically meaningful primary parameters for describing CNM clouds. The Mach number of internal macroscopic motions for CNM clouds is typically about 3 so that they are strongly supersonic, but there are wide variations. We discuss the historical $\tau$0-Ts relationship in some detail and show that it has little physical meaning. We discuss CNM morphology using the CNM pressure known from UV stellar absorption lines. Knowing the pressure allows us to show that CNM structures cannot be isotropic but instead are sheetlike, with length-to-thickness aspect ratios ranging up to about 280. We present large-scale maps of two regions where CNM lies in very large ``blobby sheets.'' We test the McKee/Ostriker model of the interstellar medium by explicitly modeling our data with CNM cores contained in WNM envelopes. This modeling scheme works quite well for many sources and also predicts the WNM filling factor reasonably well. However, it has several deficiencies.},

It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations.

abstract = {We present the velocity field of the outer Galaxy over a range in galactic longitude from 1=90° to 1=270°, out to a galactocentric radius R of about 17 kpc (2R0). The field also covers a region of the inner Galaxy, within 2-3 kpc from the Sun. The data set consists of a sample of H i: regions/reflection nebulae, for which we have (spectro-) photometric distances, and their associated molecular clouds (for which we have radial velocities). The velocity field includes non-circular motions, and consequently can be used to derive kinematic distances of objects for which only the position and radial velocity (Vlsr) are available. Adding H I tangent point data to the sample of H II regions/reflection nebulae, the data set covers a range in R from R≍02R0 to R≍2R0. For R0=8.5 kpc and $\Theta$0=220 km s-1, the best fit of a rotation curve of the form $\Theta$/$\Theta$0 = $\alpha$1(R/R0)$\alpha$2 + $\alpha$3 is obtained with $\alpha$1 = 1.00767, $\alpha$2 = 0.0394, and $\alpha$3 = 0.00712. The curve is approximately flat, but the outermost points indicate a slight rise in rotational velocity. We find that Oort's constant A = 12.6 km s-1 kpc-1. The mass of the Galaxy within R = 2R0 is found to be 4.1 1011 Msun. The velocity residuals (observed Vlsr minus Vlsr expected from circular rotation) show a pattern which suggests deviations from circular rotation that are consistent with spiral density wave streaming. No clear evidence of spiral structure is seen in the spatial distribution of the early type stars in our sample. Streaming motions (i.e. the systematic component of the velocity residuals) are found, with a mean value of ≍ 12 km s-1, implying 2-D values of ≍ 17 km s-1. We find that the molecular gas is streaming past the LSR, from l=180° to l=0°, at about 3.8 km s-1. The rotation curves fitted to Northern and Southern Hemisphere data separately, are found to differ only slightly (the difference between the rotational velocities at 20 kpc being about 5\%); this implies that, to first order, the galactic velocity field is axisymmetric. From a sample of local molecular clouds (between 0.7 and 2 kpc from the Sun), we derive the height of the Sun above the plane to be 13±7 pc. The scale height of these clouds is about 65 Pc.},

It will yield important information on the ages of the populations. The observations will be combined with data from MACHO, OGLE, EROS, VST, Spitzer, HST, Chandra, INTEGRAL, WISE, Fermi LAT, XMM-Newton, GAIA and ALMA for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the inner Milky Way. This public survey will provide data available to the whole community and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the Milky Way, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the Galactic Bulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions in the disk.

abstract = {The Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper (WHAM) has surveyed the distribution and kinematics of ionized gas in the Galaxy above declination -30°. The WHAM Northern Sky Survey (WHAM-NSS) has an angular resolution of 1° and provides the first absolutely calibrated, kinematically resolved map of the H$\alpha$ emission from the warm ionized medium (WIM) within \~{}+/-100 km s-1 of the local standard of rest. Leveraging WHAM's 12 km s-1 spectral resolution, we have modeled and removed atmospheric emission and zodiacal absorption features from each of the 37,565 spectra. The resulting H$\alpha$ profiles reveal ionized gas detected in nearly every direction on the sky with a sensitivity of 0.15 R (3 $\sigma$). Complex distributions of ionized gas are revealed in the nearby spiral arms up to 1-2 kpc away from the Galactic plane. Toward the inner Galaxy, the WHAM-NSS provides information about the WIM out to the tangent point down to a few degrees from the plane. Ionized gas is also detected toward many intermediate velocity clouds at high latitudes. Several new H II regions are revealed around early B stars and evolved stellar cores (sdB/O). This work presents the details of the instrument, the survey, and the data reduction techniques. The WHAM-NSS is also presented and analyzed for its gross properties. Finally, some general conclusions are presented about the nature of the WIM as revealed by the WHAM-NSS.},

@article{Chiappini2001,
abstract = {In this paper we adopt a chemical evolution model, which is an improved version of the Chiappini, Matteucci, \&amp; Gratton model, assuming two main accretion episodes for the formation of the Galaxy, the first forming the halo and bulge in a short timescale and the second one forming the thin disk, with a timescale that is an increasing function of the Galactocentric distance (being of the order of 7 Gyrs at the solar neighborhood). The present model takes into account in more detail than previously the halo density distribution and explores the effects of a threshold density in the star formation process during both the halo and disk phases. The model also includes the most recent nucleosynthesis prescriptions concerning supernovae of all types, novae, and single stars dying as white dwarfs. In the comparison between model predictions and available data, we have focused our attention on abundance gradients as well as gas, stellar, and star formation rate distributions along the disk, since this kind of model has already proven to be quite successful in reproducing the solar neighborhood characteristics. We suggest that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves detectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer regions of the disk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almost completely disentangled. This is due to the fact that the halo and disk densities are comparable at large Galactocentric distances and therefore the gas lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer disk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for the star formation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is necessary to reproduce the majority of observational data in the solar vicinity and in the whole disk. In particular, a threshold in the star formation implies the occurrence of a gap in the star formation at the halo-disk transition phase, in agreement with recent data. We conclude that a relatively short halo formation timescale (\~{}=0.8 Gyr), in agreement with recent estimates for the age differences among Galactic globular clusters, coupled with an ``inside-out'' formation of the Galactic disk, where the innermost regions are assumed to have formed much faster than the outermost ones, represents, at the moment, the most likely explanation for the formation of the Milky Way. This scenario allows us to predict abundance gradients and other radial properties of the Galactic disk in very good agreement with observations. Moreover, as a consequence of the adopted ``inside-out'' scenario for the disk, we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk must have increased with time and that the average \&lt;[$\alpha$/Fe]\&gt; ratios in stars (halo plus disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 kpcs from the Galactic center. We also show that the same ratios increase substantially toward the outermost disk regions and the expected scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because the outermost regions are dominated by halo stars. More observations at large Galactocentric distances are needed to test these predictions.},

Its 21-cm emission line is a key probe of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way Galaxy. About 50 years after the first detection of the 21-cm line the exploration of the Hi distribution of the Milky Way has undergone a true renaissance. This was triggered by several large-scale 21-cm surveys that became available within the past decade. New all-sky surveys unravel the shape and volume density distribution of the gaseous disk up to its borders. High-resolution Galactic plane surveys disclose a wealth of shells, filaments, and spurs that bear witness to the recycling of matter between stars and the ISM. All these observational results indicate that the Hi gas traces a dynamical Galactic ISM with structures on all scales, from tens of astronomical units to kiloparsecs. The Galaxy can be considered to be a violent, breathing disk surrounded by highly turbulent extra-planar gas.},

The RAVE program started in 2003, obtaining medium-resolution spectra (median R=7500) in the Ca-triplet region (8410-8795 \AA) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the Tycho-2 and SuperCOSMOS catalogs, in the magnitude range 9\&lt;I\&lt;12. The first data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocities for 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when including reobservations). Those data were obtained on 67 nights between 2003 April 11 and 2004 April 3. The total sky coverage within this data release is \~{}4760 deg2. The average signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra is 29.5, and 80\% of the radial velocities have uncertainties better than 3.4 km s-1. Combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode is found to be 2 km s-1. Repeat observations are used to assess the stability of our radial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km s-1. We demonstrate that the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show any systematic trend with color or signal-to-noise ratio. The RAVE radial velocities are complemented in the data release with proper motions from Starnet 2.0, Tycho-2, and SuperCOSMOS, in addition to photometric data from the major optical and infrared catalogs (Tycho-2, USNO-B, DENIS, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey).

abstract = {A comparison is made between the age-metallicity relations obtained from four different types of studies: F and G stars in the solar neighbourhood, analysis of open clusters, galactic structure studies with the stellar population synthesis technique and chemical evolution models. Metallicities of open clusters are corrected for the effects of the radial gradient, which we find to be -0.09 dex kpc\^{}-1 and most likely constant in time. We do not correct for the vertical gradient, because its existence and value are not firmly established. Stars and clusters trace a similar age-metallicity relation, showing an excess of rather metal-rich objects in the age range 5-9 Gyr. Galactic structure studies tend to give a more metal-poor relation than chemical evolution models. Neither relation explains the presence of old, relatively metal-rich stars and clusters. This might be caused by uncertainties in the ages of the local stars, or pre-enrichment of the disc with material from the bulge, possibly as a result of a merger event in the early phases of the formation of our Galaxy.},

We use a set of similar spectra obtained for solar neighborhood stars with known Teff and Mbol that is in the same range as the Galactic center (GC) sample to derive Teff and Mbol for the GC sample. We then construct the H-R diagram for the GC sample. Using an automated maximum likelihood routine, we derive a coarse star formation history of the GC. We find that (1) roughly 75\% of the stars formed in the central few parsecs are older than 5 Gyr; (2) the star formation rate (SFR) is variable over time, with a roughly 4 times higher SFR in the last 100 Myr compared to the average SFR; (3) our model can match dynamical limits on the total mass of stars formed only by limiting the initial mass function to masses above 0.7 Msolar (this could be a signature of mass segregation or of the bias toward massive star formation from the unique star formation conditions in the GC); (4) blue supergiants account for 12\% of the total sample observed, and the ratio of red to blue supergiants is roughly 1.5; and (5) models with isochrones with [Fe/H]=0.0 over all ages fit the stars in our H-R diagram better than models with lower [Fe/H] in the oldest age bins, consistent with the finding of Ram\'{\i}rez et al. that stars with ages between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr have solar [Fe/H].},

abstract = {We set new limits on the mass of the Milky Way, making use of the latest kinematic information for Galactic satellites and halo objects. Our sample consists of 11 satellite galaxies, 137 globular clusters, and 413 field horizontal-branch (FHB) stars up to distances of 10 kpc from the Sun. Roughly half of the objects in this sample have measured proper motions, permitting the use of their full space motions in our analysis. In order to bind these sample objects to the Galaxy, their rest-frame velocities must be lower than their escape velocities at their estimated distances. This constraint enables us to show that the mass estimate of the Galaxy is largely affected by several high-velocity objects (Leo I, Pal 3, Draco, and a few FHB stars), not by a single object alone (such as Leo I), as has often been the case in past analyses. We also find that a gravitational potential that gives rise to a declining rotation curve is insufficient to bind many of our sample objects to the Galaxy; a possible lower limit on the mass of the Galaxy is about 2.2x 1012 Msun. To be more quantitative, we adopt a Bayesian likelihood approach to reproduce the observed distribution of the current positions and motions of the sample, in a prescribed Galactic potential that yields a flat rotation curve. This method enables a search for the most likely total mass of the Galaxy, without undue influence in the final result arising from the presence or absence of Leo I, provided that both radial velocities and proper motions are used. Although the best mass estimate depends somewhat on the model assumptions, such as the unknown prior probabilities for the model parameters, the resultant systematic change in the mass estimate is confined to a relatively narrow range of a few times 1011 Msun, owing to our consideration of many FHB stars. The most likely total mass derived from this method is 2.5+0.5-1.0x 1012 Msun (including Leo I), and 1.8+0.4-0.7x 1012 Msun (excluding Leo I). The derived mass estimate of the Galaxy within the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud ( \~{} 50 kpc) is essentially independent of the model parameters, yielding 5.5+0.0-0.2x 1011 Msun (including Leo I) and 5.4+0.1-0.4x 1011 Msun (excluding Leo I). Implications for the origin of halo microlensing events (e.g., the possibility of brown dwarfs as the origin of the microlensing events toward the LMC, may be excluded by our lower mass limit) and prospects for more accurate estimates of the total mass are also discussed.

abstract = {We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy's supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0+/-0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1+/-0.6×106 Msolar, and the black hole's RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining R0=8.4+/-0.4 kpc and Mbh=4.5+/-0.4×106 Msolar. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4×105 Msolar within 0.01 pc, \~{}100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, ($\theta$0=229+/-18 km s-1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-$\sigma$ relation.},

abstract = {The abundance gradients and the radial gas profile of the Galactic disc are analysed by means of a model for the chemical evolution of galaxies. As one of the major uncertainties in models for galaxy evolution is the star formation (SF) process, various SF laws are considered, to assess the response of model predictions to the different assumptions. Only some SF laws are successful in reproducing the metallicity gradient, and only if combined with a suitable infall timescale increasing outward (inside-out formation scenario). Still, it is difficult to reproduce at the same time also the observed gas distribution; we therefore suggest further improvements for the models.},

Among these, we have a new spectroscopically confirmed T5 dwarf, an additional T dwarf with estimated type T6, 13 new L dwarf candidates, and two new common proper motion systems containing ultracool dwarf candidates. We provide improved proper motions for an additional 12 high proper motion stars that were independently discovered in the WISE data set during the course of this investigation.},

abstract = {The GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire) Point Source Catalog of \~{}30 million mid-infrared sources toward the inner Galaxy, 10°\&lt;=|l|\&lt;=65° and |b|\&lt;=1°, was used to determine the distribution of stars in Galactic longitude, l, latitude, b, and apparent magnitude, m. The counts versus longitude can be approximated by the modified Bessel function N=N0(l/l0)K1(l/l0), where l0 is insensitive to limiting magnitude, band choice, and side of Galactic center: l0=17°-30° with a best-fit value in the 4.5 $\mu$m band of l0=24°+/-4°. Modeling the source distribution as an exponential disk yields a radial scale length of H*=3.9+/-0.6 kpc. There is a pronounced north-south asymmetry in source counts for |l|\&lt;\~{}30°, with \~{}25\% more stars in the north. For l=10°-30°, there is a strong enhancement of stars of m=11.5-13.5 mag. A linear bar passing through the Galactic center with half-length Rbar=4.4+/-0.5 kpc, tilted by $\phi$=44°+/-10° to the Sun-Galactic center line, provides the simplest interpretation of these data. We examine the possibility that enhanced source counts at l= 26°-28°, 31.5d-34°, and 306°-309° are related to Galactic spiral structure. Total source counts are depressed in regions where the counts of red objects (mK-m[8.0]\&gt;3) peak. In these areas, the counts are reduced by extinction due to molecular gas, high diffuse backgrounds associated with star formation, or both.},

Here, an approach is described which uses hierarchical Bayesian models to simultaneously and empirically determine the mean distance-extinction relationship for a sightline and the properties of stars which populate it. By exploiting the hierarchical nature of the problem, the method described is able to achieve significantly improved precision and accuracy with respect to previous 3D extinction mapping techniques. This method is not tied to any individual survey and could be applied to any observations, or combination of observations available. Furthermore, it is extendible and, in addition, could be employed to study Galactic structure as well as factors such as the initial mass function and star formation history in the Galaxy.},

In the K band, which traces stellar emission and suffers little from absorbtion, features associated with the arm tangents indicate that a two-armed logarithmic spiral dominates the nonaxisymmetric structure of the Milky Way. In contrast, the 240 mum emission from dust entrained in the interstellar gas is consistent with a four-armed model, in concordance with radio data and optical spiral tracers. This suggests that the non-axisymmetric mass perturbation responsible for the four-armed spiral structure in the gas has a two rather than four-armed structure.},

The newly uncovered PNe will help to improve the census of this important population of Galactic objects that serve as key windows into the late-stage evolution of low- to intermediate-mass stars. They will also facilitate study of the faint end of the ensemble Galactic PN luminosity function. The sensitivity and coverage of IPHAS allows PNe to be found in regions of greater extinction in the Galactic plane and/or those PNe in a more advanced evolutionary state and at larger distances compared to the general Galactic PN population. Using a set of newly revised optical diagnostic diagrams in combination with access to a powerful, new, multiwavelength imaging data base, we have identified 159 true, likely and possible PNe for this first catalogue release. The ability of IPHAS to unveil PNe at low Galactic latitudes and towards the Galactic Anticentre, compared to previous surveys, makes this survey an ideal tool to contribute to the improvement of our knowledge of the whole Galactic PN population.},

@article{Robin2014,
abstract = {Aims: More than 30 years after its discovery, the thick disc of the Milky Way is not fully explored. We examine the shape of the thick disc in order to gain insight into the process of its formation.  Methods: The shape of the thick disc is studied in detail using photometric data at high and intermediate latitudes from SDSS and 2MASS surveys. We adopted the population synthesis approach using an approximate Bayesian computation - Markov chain Monte Carlo (ABC-MCMC) method to determine the potential degeneracies in the parameters that can be caused by the mixing with the halo and the thin disc. We characterised the thick-disc shape, scale height, scale length, local density, and flare, and we investigated the extent of the thick-disc formation period by simulating several formation episodes.  Results: We find that the vertical variation in density is not exponential, but much closer to a hyperbolic secant squared. Assuming a single formation epoch, the thick disc is better fitted with a sech2 scale height of 470 pc and a scale length of 2.3 kpc. However, if one simulates two successive formation episodes, which mimicks an extended formation period, the older episode has a higher scale height and a longer scale length than the younger episode, which indicates a contraction during the collapse phase. The scale height decreases from 800 pc to 340 pc, the scale length from 3.2 kpc to 2 kpc. The likelihood is much higher when the thick disc formation extends over a longer period. We also show that star formation increases from the old episode to the young and that there is no flare in the outskirt of the thick disc during the main episode. We compare our results with formation scenarios of the thick disc. During the fitting process, the halo parameters are determined as well. If a power-law density is assumed, it has an exponent of 3.3 and an axis ratio of 0.7. Alternatively, a Hernquist shape would have an exponent of 2.76, an axis ratio of 0.77, and a core radius of 2.1 kpc. The constraint on the halo shows that a transition between an inner and outer halo, if it exists, cannot be at a distance shorter than about 30 kpc, which is the limit of our investigation using turnoff halo stars. Finally, we show that extrapolating the thick disc towards the bulge region explains well the stellar populations observed there that there is no longer need to invoke a classical bulge.  Conclusions: The facts that the thick-disc episode lasted for several billion years, that a contraction is observed during the collapse phase, and that the main thick disc has a constant scale height with no flare argue against the formation of the thick disc through radial migration. The most probable scenario for the thick disc is that it formed while the Galaxy was gravitationally collapsing from well-mixed gas-rich giant clumps that were sustained by high turbulence, which prevented a thin disc from forming for a time, as proposed previously. This scenario explains well the observations in the thick-disc region and in the bulge region.  Figures 8-11 and Appendix A are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

At the peripheries of the Galaxy, the amplitude of the warp, derived from these data, may be as high as ˜ 1 kpc. The scale-height of the pulsar distribution increases exponentially from ˜ 0.5 kpc to ˜ 1 kpc while increasing the galactocentric distance from 5 kpc to 15 kpc.

New analyses of the observational data are presented here, namely, a statistical analysis is brought to bear on the wide range of pitch angle values derived from eight observational methods, comparisons are made between the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies that look like the Milky Way, and a comparison is made with two spiral models (a logarithmic-type model and a flocculent-type model). For the first time, magnetic field data are used in a statistical study of spiral arm characteristics.

abstract = {We have previously published medium- to high-resolution spectroscopic observations of early B-type main-sequence objects, lying in 18 young, stellar clusters and associations or the general disk population, over galactocentric distances 6 <\~{} Rg <\~{} 18 kpc. Using a homogeneous subset of stars with similar atmospheric parameters, we have reanalyzed the O II line spectra using non-LTE line formation calculations. We derive an oxygen abundance gradient of -0.07 +/- 0.01 dex kpc-1, which should be representative of the present-day interstellar medium within the Galaxy. This extensive and self-consistent data set represents a considerable advance on previous attempts to measure the Galactic oxygen abundance gradient using early-type stars and produces a significant gradient for the first time. The outer disk is well sampled, which gives the result statistical significance, and the discrepancies with previous similar studies are discussed. We compare this new result to those derived using Galactic H II regions and planetary nebulae and conclude that the different methods now appear to produce consistent agreement.},

abstract = {The UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) of the Anglo-Australian Observatory completed a narrow-band H$\alpha$ plus [NII] 6548, 6584-\AA survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Magellanic Clouds in late 2003. The survey, which was the last UKST wide-field photographic survey and the only one undertaken in a narrow-band, is now an online digital data product of the Wide-Field Astronomy Unit of the Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE). The survey utilized a high specification, monolithic H$\alpha$ interference bandpass filter of exceptional quality. In conjunction with the fine-grained Tech-Pan film as a detector it has produced a survey with a powerful combination of area coverage (4000 square degrees), resolution (\~{}1 arcsec) and sensitivity (\&lt;=5 Rayleighs), reaching a depth for continuum point sources of R\~{}= 20.5. The main survey consists of 233 individual fields on a grid of centres separated by 4° at declinations below +2° and covers a swathe approximately 20° wide about the Southern Galactic Plane. The original survey films were scanned by the SuperCOSMOS measuring machine at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, to provide the online digital atlas called the SuperCOSMOS H$\alpha$ Survey (SHS). We present the background of the survey, the key survey characteristics, details and examples of the data product, calibration process, comparison with other surveys and a brief description of its potential for scientific exploitation.},

@article{Barentsen2013,
abstract = {There are many pertinent open issues in the area of star and planet formation. Large statistical samples of young stars across star-forming regions are needed to trigger a breakthrough in our understanding, but most optical studies are based on a wide variety of spectrographs and analysis methods, which introduces large biases.  Here we show how graphical Bayesian networks can be employed to construct a hierarchical probabilistic model which allows pre-main-sequence ages, masses, accretion rates and extinctions to be estimated using two widely available photometric survey data bases (Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey r'/H$\alpha$/i' and Two Micron All Sky Survey J-band magnitudes). Because our approach does not rely on spectroscopy, it can easily be applied to ho-mogeneously study the large number of clusters for which Gaia will yield membership lists.  We explain how the analysis is carried out using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method and provide PYTHON source code. We then demonstrate its use on 587 known low-mass members of the star-forming region NGC 2264 (Cone Nebula), arriving at a median age of 3.0 Myr, an accretion fraction of 20 ± 2 per cent and a median accretion rate of 10-8.4 M⊙ yr-1.  The Bayesian analysis formulated in this work delivers results which are in agreement with spectroscopic studies already in the literature, but achieves this with great efficiency by depending only on photometry. It is a significant step forward from previous photometric studies because the probabilistic approach ensures that nuisance parameters, such as extinction and distance, are fully included in the analysis with a clear picture on any degeneracies.},

@article{VanderKruit1981,
abstract = {In this paper we investigate the three-dimensional distribution of light in galactic disks as a first step towards a comprehensive study of the structure of edge-on spiral galaxies. The model has the feature of being isothermal in z at all radii with a scale parameter z0 and has an exponential dependence of surface brightness upon R with a scalelength h. When we apply this model to previously published photometry of NGC 4244 and 5907 (van der Kruit, 1979), edge-on spiral galaxies without an appreciable bulge, we find: 1. To an excellent approximation the scale parameter z0 is independent of R. 2. The radial dependence requires a cut-off at a radius Rmax of a few scale-lengths h. This cut-off is very sharp with an e-folding less than about 1 kpc. This sets an upper limit of about 10 km s-1 to the radial velocity dispersion in the stars near Rmax. 3. Comparison to the solar neighbourhood shows that we are fitting the self-gravitating intermediate population II and disk population. This self-gravitating, locally-isothermal, truncated, exponential disk model has a number of interesting features - in particular in connection with finding (1) - which are discussed at the end of the paper. The predicted radial dependence of the velocity dispersion 2z\&gt;1/2 upon R is a basic characteristic of these disks, which is in principle open to observational verification. Application of our model disk to NGC 4565 and subtracting it from the observed surface brightness distribution reveals the light distribution in its prominent bulge and spheroid. In contrast to NGC 4244 and 5907 there is evidence for a "thick disk" in Burstein's (1979c) sense; however we infer from the considerable flattening of the spheroid isophotes with radius that this luminosity is presumably nothing other than the halo population responding to the gravitational field of the disk.},

A total of 1788 star cluster candidates are identified in this survey. Among those are 681 previously known open clusters and 86 globular clusters. A statistical analysis indicates that our sample of 1021 new cluster candidates has a contamination of about 50per cent. Star cluster parameters are obtained by fitting a King profile to the star density. These parameters are used to statistically identify probable new globular cluster candidates in our sample. A detailed investigation of the projected distribution of star clusters in the Galaxy demonstrates that they show a clear tendency to cluster on spatial scales in the order of 12-25pc, a typical size for molecular clouds.},

This catalog lists 150 warped galaxies out of a sample of 276 edge-on galaxies and covers the whole southern hemisphere, except the Avoidance Zone. It is therefore very suitable for statistical studies of warps. It also provides a source guide for detailed particular observations. We confirm the large frequency of warped spirals: nearly all galaxies are warped. The frequency and warp angle do not present important differences for the different types of spirals. However, no lenticular warped galaxy has been found within the specified limits. This finding constitutes an important restriction for theoretical models.},

abstract = {Hi-GAL, the Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey, is an Open Time Key Project of the Herschel Space Observatory. It will make an unbiased photometric survey of the inner Galactic plane by mapping a  wide strip in the longitude range  in five wavebands between 70 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$m. The aim of Hi-GAL is to detect the earliest phases of the formation of molecular clouds and high-mass stars and to use the optimum combination of Herschel wavelength coverage, sensitivity, mapping strategy, and speed to deliver a homogeneous census of star-forming regions and cold structures in the interstellar medium. The resulting representative samples will yield the variation of source temperature, luminosity, mass and age in a wide range of Galactic environments at all scales from massive YSOs in protoclusters to entire spiral arms, providing an evolutionary sequence for the formation of intermediate and high-mass stars. This information is essential to the formulation of a predictive global model of the role of environment and feedback in regulating the star-formation process. Such a model is vital to understanding star formation on galactic scales and in the early universe. Hi-GAL will also provide a science legacy for decades to come with incalculable potential for systematic and serendipitous science in a wide range of astronomical fields, enabling the optimum use of future major facilities such as JWST and ALMA.},

abstract = {We present a power spectrum analysis of the Herschel-SPIRE observations of the Polaris flare, a high Galactic latitude cirrus cloud midway between the diffuse and molecular phases. The SPIRE images of the Polaris flare reveal for the first time the structure of the diffuse interstellar medium down to 0.01 parsec over a 10 square degrees region. These exceptional observations highlight the highly filamentary and clumpy structure of the interstellar medium even in diffuse regions of the map. The power spectrum analysis shows that the structure of the interstellar medium is well described by a single power law with an exponent of -2.7±0.1 at all scales from 30” to 8°. That the power spectrum slope of the dust emission is constant down to the SPIRE angular resolution is an indication that the inertial range of turbulence extends down to the 0.01 pc scale. The power spectrum analysis also allows the identification of a Poissonian component at sub-arcminute scales in agreement with predictions of the cosmic infrared background level at SPIRE wavelengths. Finally, the comparison of the SPIRE and IRAS 100 $\mu$m data of the Polaris flare clearly assesses the capability of SPIRE in maping diffuse emission over large areas.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Figures 4-6 are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

abstract = {The velocity dispersion of nearby stars in the Galactic disc is well known to increase substantially with age; this is the so-called age-velocity relation, and is interpreted as a `heating' of the disc as a function of time. We have studied the heating of the Galactic stellar disc caused by giant molecular clouds and halo black holes, via simulations of the orbits of tracer stars embedded in a patch of the local Galactic disc. We examine a range of masses and number densities of the giant molecular cloud and halo black hole perturbers. The heating of the stellar disc in the simulations is fitted with a simple power law of the form $\sigma$\~{}t$\alpha$, where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the tracer stars as a function of time, t. We also fit this form to the best determinations of the increase in the velocity dispersion as a function of time as derived from stars in the solar neighbourhood for which ages can be reliably assigned. Observationally, $\alpha$ is found to lie in the range 0.3-0.6, i.e. it remains poorly constrained and its determination is probably still dominated by systematic errors. Better constrained observationally is the ratio of the velocity dispersions of the stars in the vertical z and horizontal x directions (i.e. towards the Galactic Centre), $\sigma$z/$\sigma$x= 0.5 +/- 0.1. For the heating of the stellar disc caused by giant molecular clouds (GMCs) we derive a heating $\sigma$\~{}t0.21, which differs somewhat from early (analytic) studies in which $\sigma$\~{}t1/4. This confirms the well-known results that there are insufficient GMCs to heat the Galactic disc appropriately. A range of dark halo black hole scenarios are verified to heat the stellar disc as $\sigma$\~{}t1/2 (as expected from analytical studies), and give $\sigma$z/$\sigma$x in the range 0.5-0.6, which is consistent with observations. Black holes with a mass of 107 Msolar are our favoured disc heaters, although they are only marginally consistent with observations. Simulations featuring a combination of giant molecular clouds and halo black holes can explain the observed heating of the stellar disc, but since other perturbing mechanisms, such as spiral arms, are yet to be included, we regard this solution as being ad hoc.},

A two-color selection criterion has been developed and carefully calibrated using stars which are known to be embedded in molecular clouds. When applied to the sensitive IRAS all-sky survey, a direct measure of the total number and distribution of embedded massive stars in the Galaxy is obtained. A lower limit is derived on the current O star formation rate in the Galaxy, the contribution O stars make to the FIR luminosity of the Galaxy is estimated, and it is shown that the number of IRAS sources found is consistent with a Galactic supernova rate of about one every 25 yrs.},

abstract = {Context: The determination of the global structure of the planar and extra-planar Milky Way H I disk depends critically on a reliable database but also on reasonable assumptions about the shape of the Milky Way rotation curve.  Aims: We derive the 3D H I volume density distribution for the Galactic disk out to R ˜ 60 kpc.   Methods: Our analysis is based on parameters for the warp and rotation curve derived previously. The data are taken from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21 cm line survey.  Results: The Milky Way H I disk is significantly warped but shows a coherent structure out to R ˜ 35 kpc. The radial surface density distribution, the densities in the middle of the warped plane, and the H I scale heights all follow exponential relations. The radial scale length for the surface density distribution of the H I disk is 3.75 kpc. Gas at the outskirts for 40 ⪉ R ⪉ 60 kpc is described best by a distribution with an exponential radial scale length of 7.5 kpc and a velocity dispersion of 74 km s-1. Such a highly turbulent medium fits also well with the average shape of the high velocity profile wings observed at high latitudes. The turbulent pressure gradient of such extra-planar gas is on average in balance with the gravitational forces. About 10\% of the Milky Way H I gas is in this state. The large scale H I distribution is lopsided; for R ⪆ 15 kpc there is more gas in the south. The H I flaring indicates that this asymmetry is caused by a dark matter wake, located at R ˜ 25 kpc in direction of the Magellanic System. Conclusions: The H I disk is made up of two major components. Most prominent is the normal H I disk which can be traced to R ˜ 35 kpc. This is surrounded by a patchy distribution of highly turbulent gas reaching large scale heights but also large radial distances. At the position of the Sun the exponential scale height in the z direction is 3.9 kpc. This component resembles the anomalous gas discovered previously in some galaxies.},

Most free parameters are first constrained using solar neighborhood data. Only those parameters which cannot be satisfactorily bound by local data are fitted to star counts. The model can be used to derive reliable predictions in any other galactic direction but the center. In the course of model elaboration, a number of quantitative results are given or confirmed; the most outstanding ones concern the densities and space distributions of Halo and Intermediate Population II stars.},

The observations are used to obtain accurate radial velocities and to estimate each star's chemical abundance and photometric parallax. The results are used to measure the radial variation of the mean motions and velocity dispersion in the plane of the old disk and of (Fe/H) from about 1 to 17 kpc in Galactocentric radius. The observed exponential decrease with radius of the radial component of the velocity dispersion gives an estimate of the disk's radial scale length that is consistent with other recent structural determinations. This agreement indicate that the anisotropy of the velocity dispersion of the old disk is uniform through the disk. The inner parts of the old disk are hot, and the random motions can stabilize the disk against global bisymmetric modes. Possible mechanisms to produce such large random motions are discussed.},

Supplied handlers provide support for VOTables, FITS table extensions, relational databases via SQL and plain text tables, amongst others. The VOTable handler is believed to be the only existing library capable of reading or writing all the defined VOTable encoding formats (tabledata, fits, binary).  TOPCAT, based on STIL, is a user-friendly graphical program for viewing, analysis and editing of tables.

abstract = {Stellar photometry derived from the INT/WFC Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS) of the Northern Galactic plane can be used to identify large, reliable samples of A0-A5 stars. For every A-type star, so identified, it is also possible to derive individual reddening and distance estimates, under the assumption that most selected objects are on or near the main sequence, at a mean absolute r' magnitude of 1.5-1.6. This study presents the method for obtaining such samples and shows that the known reddenings and distances to the open clusters NGC 7510 and NGC 7790 are successfully recovered. A sample of over 1000 A-type stars is then obtained from IPHAS data in the magnitude range 13.5 < r' < 20 from the region of sky including the massive northern OB association Cyg OB2. An analysis of these data reveals a concentration of \~{}200 A stars over an area about a degree across, offset mainly to the south of the known 1-3 Myr old OB stars in Cyg OB2: their dereddened r' magnitudes fall in the range 11.8-12.5.

abstract = {The process of swing amplification is discussed as a possible mechanism to account for the spiral structure of galaxies. The mechanism is proposed to occur in a thin infinite disk of stars with a Gaussian spread of radial velocities orbiting in a force field corresponding to the flattest imaginable law of circular motion, with half of the central force field coming from a rigid and fixed spheroidal halo, which is subject to disturbances resulting from weak, transient external quadrupole forces revolving counterclockwise with the same angular speed as the test particles in the outermost circles. The amplification is shown to result from a combination of galactic shear flow, epicyclic shaking and self-gravity, and to be characterized by oscillations with amplitudes about four times larger than kinematic and arms wound more tightly and of greater density than kinematic features. The unstable spiral modes of a Gaussian disk are then examined, and implications of the swing amplification theory for the prevention of violent bar-making instabilities of disks and the lifetimes of the spiral patterns in normal spirals such as M51 and M81 are noted.},

abstract = {Context. The understanding of Galaxy evolution can be facilitated by the use of population synthesis models, which allows us to test hypotheses on the star formation history, star evolution, and chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy.  Aims: The new version of the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model (BGM) aims to provide a more flexible and powerful tool to investigate the initial mass function (IMF) and star formation rate (SFR) of the Galactic disc.  Methods: We present a new strategy for the generation of thin disc stars, which assumes the IMF, SFR and evolutionary tracks as free parameters. We have updated most of the ingredients for the star count production and, for the first time, binary stars are generated in a consistent way. The local dynamical self-consistency is maintained in this new scheme. We then compare simulations from the new model with Tycho-2 data and the local luminosity function, as a first test to verify and constrain the new ingredients. The effects of changing thirteen different ingredients of the model are systematically studied.  Results: For the first time, a full sky comparison is performed between BGM and data. This strategy allows us to constrain the IMF slope at high masses, which is found to be close to 3.0 and excludes a shallower slope such as Salpeter's one. The SFR is found decreasing whatever IMF is assumed. The model is compatible with a local dark matter density of 0.011 M⊙ pc-3 implying that there is no compelling evidence for the significant amount of dark matter in the disc. While the model is fitted to Tycho-2 data, which is a magnitude limited sample with V\&lt; 11, we check that it is still consistent with fainter stars.  Conclusions: The new model constitutes a new basis for further comparisons with large scale surveys and is being prepared to become a powerful tool for the analysis of the Gaia mission data.

This result is in good agreement with earlier work by Geller and Beers (1982) based on number counts.

The distribution of cataloged giant H II regions was compared with the face-on molecular hydrogen distribution.

abstract = {The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) surveyed the entire Galactic plane within |b|\&lt;=5deg in four mid-infrared spectral bands between 6 and 25 $\mu$m at a spatial resolution of \~{}18.3". The survey was redundant within |b|\&lt;=4.5d with four-fold coverage over two-thirds of the area. These survey data were combined to create 1680 1.5d×1.5d images that cover the region with 6" pixel spacing in each of the spectral bands. The images preserve the inherent resolution of the data but have up to twice the sensitivity of a single scan. The individual survey observations had to be extensively conditioned to achieve the co-add advantage. The noise equivalent radiance (NER) at 8.3 $\mu$m, the most sensitive MSX mid-infrared spectral band, varies from \~{}1.3 MJy sr-1 in the inner Galaxy to 3 times that at the latitude limits in the outer Galaxy; the sensitivities of the other MSX mid-infrared bands are 10-25 times less. Additionally, 36 lower resolution 10deg×10deg images were generated in each band that span the full latitude and longitude range of the survey. These panoramic images have a resolution of \~{}1.2‧ with 36" pixel spacing and a six-fold improvement in NER, making them an ideal product for comparison with radio surveys of the Galactic plane. An ancillary set of images has been created from other MSX astronomy experiments that lie within 10° of the Galactic plane. These images either extend the latitude coverage of the survey or provide deeper probes of Galactic structure either by themselves or when added to the survey images.},

The model predicts that, to be efficient, the magnetic field must have a direction not much different from 45 deg with the galactic plane. The required values of the field strength are uncertain, of about 10 nG, higher values being favored. When observed galaxies are used to determine the directions of the IGMF responsible for their warps, a noticeable regular alignment is found.

abstract = {New observations with Herschel allow accurate measurement of the equilibrium temperature of large dust grains heated by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), which is critical in deriving dust column density and masses. We present temperature maps derived from the Herschel SPIRE and PACS data in two fields along the Galactic plane, obtained as part of the Hi-GAL survey during the Herschel science demonstration phase (SDP). We analyze the distribution of the dust temperature spatially, as well as along the two lines-of-sight (LOS) through the Galaxy. The zero-level offsets in the Herschel maps were established by comparison with the IRAS and Planck data at comparable wavelengths. We derive maps of the dust temperature and optical depth by adjusting a detailed model for dust emission at each pixel. The dust temperature maps show variations in the ISRF intensity and reveal the intricate mixture of the warm dust heated by massive stars and the cold filamentary structures of embedded molecular clouds. The dust optical depth at 250$\mu$m is well correlated with the gas column density, but with a significantly higher dust emissivity than in the solar neighborhood. We correlate the optical depth with 3-D cubes of the dust extinction to investigate variations in the ISRF strength and dust abundance along the line of sight through the spiral structure of the Galaxy. We show that the warmest dust along the LOS is located in the spiral arms of the Galaxy, and we quantify their respective IR contribution.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Figures 3-6 are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

abstract = {A brief description is given of the GLIMPSE surveys, including the areas surveyed, sensitivity limits, and products. The primary motivations for this review are to describe some of the main scientific results enabled by the GLIMPSE surveys and to note potential future applications of the GLIMPSE catalogs and images. In particular, we discuss contributions to our understanding of star formation and early evolution, the interstellar medium, galactic structure, and evolved stars. Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared bubbles/H II regions are discussed in some detail. A probable triggered star formation associated with expanding infrared bubbles is briefly mentioned. The distribution and morphologies of dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium are discussed. Examples are shown from GLIMPSE images of bow shocks, pillars (elephant trunks), and instabilities in massive star-formation regions. The infrared extinction law of diffuse interstellar dust is discussed. The large-scale structure of the Galaxy has been traced by red-clump giants using the GLIMPSE point-source catalog to reveal the radius and orientation of the central bar, the stellar radial scale length, an obvious increase in star counts toward the tangency to the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm, the lack of an obvious tangency from star counts toward the Sagittarius spiral arm, and a sharp increase in star counts toward the nuclear bulge. Recent results on evolved stars and some serendipitous discoveries are mentioned. More than 70 refereed papers have been published based on GLIMPSE data as of 2008 November.},

@article{Bailer-Jones2011,
abstract = {Astrometric surveys provide the opportunity to measure the absolute magnitudes of large numbers of stars, but only if the individual line-of-sight extinctions are known. Unfortunately, extinction is highly degenerate with stellar effective temperature when estimated from broad-band optical/infrared photometry. To address this problem, I introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction. It uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to provide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the parameters. The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure that they respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by using it to estimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK data for a set of artificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which accurate effective temperatures have been estimated from high-resolution spectroscopy. Using just the four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation) between the temperature and extinction. Introducing the parallax, apparent magnitude and the HRD reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision (reduces the error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, the latter by about 35 per cent. The resulting accuracy is about 200 K in temperature and 0.2 mag in extinction. I then apply the method to estimate these parameters and absolute magnitudes for some 47 000 F, G, K Hipparcos stars which have been cross-matched with Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). The method can easily be extended to incorporate the estimation of other parameters, in particular metallicity and surface gravity, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of the 109 stars from Gaia.},

Changes in the angular momenta of individual stars are typically as large as \~{}50 per cent over the lifetime of the disc. The changes are concentrated around the corotation radius for an individual spiral wave, but since transient waves with a wide range of pattern speeds develop in rapid succession, the entire disc is affected. This behaviour has profound consequences for the metallicity gradients with radius in both stars and gas, since the interstellar medium is also stirred by the same mechanism. We find observational support for stirring, propose a simple model for the distribution of stars over metallicity and age, and discuss other possible consequences.},

abstract = {Context. There is a continuing debate as to the form of the outer disc of the Milky Way galaxy, which has important implications for understanding the Galaxy's formation. Stars are known to exist at a galacto-centric distance of at least 20 kpc. However, there is much debate as to whether these stars can be explained as part of the disc or whether another extragalactic structure, the so-called Monoceros ring/stream, is required Aims: We examine the outer disc of the Galaxy toward the anti-centre to determine whether the star counts can be explained by the thin and thick discs alone. Methods: By using Sloan star counts and extracting the late F and early G dwarfs, it is possible to directly determine the density of stars out to a galacto-centric distance of about 25 kpc. These are then compared with a simple flared-disc model. Results: A flared-disc model is shown to reproduce the counts along the lines of sight examined, if the thick disc does not have a sharp cut off. The flare starts at a Galacto-centric radius of 16 kpc and has a scale length of 4.5 ± 1.5 kpc Conclusions: Whilst the interpretation of the counts in terms of a ring/stream cannot be definitely discounted, it does not appear to be necessary, at least along the lines of sight examined towards the anti centre.},

abstract = {In response to recent criticism by Momany et al., that the recently identified Canis Major (CMa) overdensity could be simply explained by the Galactic warp, we present proof of the existence of a stellar population in the direction of CMa that cannot be explained by known Galactic components. By analysing the radial distribution of counts of M-giant stars in this direction, we show that the Momany et al. warp model overestimates the number of stars in the Northern hemisphere, hence hiding the CMa feature in the South. The use of a better model of the warp has little influence on the morphology of the overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a distance of D= 7.2 +/- 0.3 kpc. To lend further support to the existence of a population that does not belong to the Galactic disc, we present radial velocities of M-giant stars in the centre of the CMa structure that were obtained with the 2dF spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The extra population shows a radial velocity of vr= 109 +/- 4 km s-1, which is significantly higher than the typical velocity of the disc at the distance of CMa. This population also has a low dispersion (13 +/- 4 kms-1). The Canis Major overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due to the Galactic warp, adding weight to the hypothesis that we are observing a disrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants. This leads to questions on what part of CMa was previously identified as the Warp and how possibly to disentangle the two structures.},

abstract = {The Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) has mapped the surface brightness distributions of the Galactic plane at wavelengths from 1.25 to 240 micrometers. In these maps the latitude of peak brightness, as a function of longitude, traces a roughly sinusoidal curve of period approximately 360 deg. In the far-infrared, where emission by interstellar dust dominates the surface brightness, this curve agrees well with that derived from maps of the velocity-integrated H 1, suggesting that the layers of dust and neutral atomic hydrogen are similarly displaced from the Galactic plane. In the near-infrared (lambda less than 5 micrometers), where old disk stars dominate the emission, the brightness crest exhibits the same phase but roughly half the amplitude. The reduced amplitude of the warp in stellar light could result from a lesser warping of the stellar disk, or from a more rapid falloff of the density of stars relative to the density of gas, possibly due to a radial truncation of the disk.},

The survey is aimed at revealing the large scale organization of the Milky Way and can be applied to identifying a range of stellar populations within it. Mapping emission line objects enables a particular focus on objects in the young and old stages of stellar evolution ranging from early T-Tauri stars to late planetary nebulae. In this paper we present the IPHAS Initial Data Release, primarily a photometric catalogue of about 200 million unique objects, coupled with associated image data covering about 1600 deg2 in three passbands. We note how access to the primary data products has been implemented through use of standard virtual observatory publishing interfaces. Simple traditional web access is provided to the main IPHAS photometric catalogue, in addition to a number of common catalogues (such as 2MASS) which are of immediate relevance. Access through the AstroGrid VO Desktop opens up the full range of analysis options, and allows full integration with the wider range of data and services available through the Virtual Observatory. The IDR represents the largest data set published primarily through VO interfaces to date, and so stands as an exemplar of the future of survey data mining. Examples of data access are given, including a cross-matching of IPHAS photometry with sources in the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey that validates the existing calibration of the best data.},

abstract = {The observational surveys and methods aimed at constraining the distribution function of stellar masses can be subdivided into three broad mass regimes, each of which has its own peculiar difficulties and biases: massive stars (m > 5 Modot approximately), low-mass stars (0.8-0.1 Modot) and brown dwarfs (0.08-0.01 Modot). Taking account of biases through unresolved multiple systems, incompleteness and dynamical effects, such as mass segregation and ejection of massive stars from clusters, and assuming the IMF is continuous, I show that it can be approximated by the following three-part power-law form for population I stars (Salpeter: $\alpha$ = 2.35): $\alpha$ (m) = +0.3 \&0.01 < m/Modot < 0.08, +1.3 \&0.08 < m/Modot < 0.5, +2.3 \&0.5 < m/Modot, where $\xi$(m)dm is the number of stars in the mass interval m to m+dm, and $\xi$(m) \~{} m-$\alpha$. The IMF is well constrained in the mass range 0.1-0.8 Modot, where it cannot be approximated by a single power-law. The uncertainty in $\alpha$ in this mass range is $\delta$$\alpha$ ≅ 0.2. Below the hydrogen burning mass limit, $\alpha$ remains rather uncertain, with values between about $\alpha$ = 0 and 1.0. The data show evidence for two changes of the power-law index only, namely near 0.5 Modot and 0.08 Modot. In addition, the various surveys of OB associations and young clusters lead to a constant scatter of $\delta$$\alpha$ ≅ 0.5 in the range ≅ 1-100 Modot. Massive stars have a high multiplicity fraction, and correction for this may systematically steepen the IMF further to $\alpha$ ≅ 2.5-2.7 for m>1 Modot.},

abstract = {We present new observations of the nuclear star cluster in the central parsec of the Galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT. Our work allows the spectroscopic detection of early- and late-type stars to mK \&gt;= 16, more than 2 mag deeper than our previous data sets. Our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fide early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O-, and B-stars reside in two strongly warped disks between 0farcs8 and 12'' from Sgr A*, as well as a central compact concentration (the S-star cluster) centered on Sgr A*. The later type B-stars (mK \&gt;15) in the radial interval between 0farcs8 and 12'' seem to be in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. The observed dearth of late-type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowing for stellar collisions. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is extremely top heavy with a best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -0.45± 0.3. WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event \~{}6 Myr ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF). The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0farcs8 and of the early-type stars at distances beyond 12'' are compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best-fit power law of dN/dm vprop m -2.15± 0.3).

@article{Yoachim2006,
abstract = {We analyze the global structure of 34 late-type, edge-on, undisturbed, disk galaxies spanning a wide range of mass. We measure structural parameters for the galaxies using two-dimensional least-squares fitting to our R-band photometry. The fits require both a thick and a thin disk to adequately fit the data. The thick disks have larger scale heights and longer scale lengths than the embedded thin disks by factors of \~{}2 and \~{}1.25, respectively. The observed structural parameters agree well with the properties of thick and thin disks derived from star counts in the Milky Way and from resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies. We find that massive galaxies' luminosities are dominated by the thin disk. However, in low-mass galaxies (Vc<\~{}120 km s-1) thick disk stars contribute nearly half the luminosity and dominate the stellar mass. Thus, although low-mass dwarf galaxies appear blue, the majority of their stars are probably quite old. Our data are most easily explained by a formation scenario in which the thick disk is assembled through direct accretion of stellar material from merging satellites while the thin disk is formed from accreted gas. The baryonic fraction in the thin disk therefore constrains the gas richness of the merging pregalactic fragments. If we include the mass in H I as part of the thin disk, the thick disk contains <\~{}10\% of the baryons in high-mass galaxies and \~{}25\%-30\% of the baryons in low-mass galaxies. Our data, therefore, indicate that the fragments were quite gas rich at the time of merging (fgas=75\%-90\%). However, because low-mass galaxies have a smaller fraction of baryons in their thin disks, the pregalactic fragments from which they assembled must have been systematically more gas poor. We believe this trend results from increased outflow due to supernova-driven winds in the lower mass pregalactic fragments. We estimate that \~{}60\% of the total baryonic mass in these systems was lost due to outflows. Pushing the episode of significant winds to early times allows the mass-metallicity relationship for disks to be established early, before the main disk is assembled, and obviates the difficulty in driving winds from diffuse disks with low star formation efficiencies. We discuss other implications of this scenario for solving the G dwarf problem, for predicting abundance trends in thick disks, and for removing discrepancies between semianalytic galaxy formation models and the observed colors of low-mass galaxies.},

@article{Wood1998,
abstract = {Observationally, white dwarf stars are a remarkably homogeneous class with a minimum observed Teff \~{} 4000 K. Theoretically, the physics that determines their cooling timescales is relatively more straightforward than that which determines main-sequence evolutionary timescales. As a result, the white dwarf luminosity function has for the last decade been used as a probe of the age and star formation rate of the Galactic disk, providing an estimated local disk age of \~{}10 Gyr with estimated total uncertainties of roughly 20\%. A long-standing criticism of the technique is that the reality of the reported downturn in the luminosity function (LF) hinges on just a handful of stars and on statistical arguments that fainter (older) objects would have been observed were they present. Indeed, the likely statistical variations of these small-number samples represent one of the primary uncertainties in the derived Galactic age, and the behavior of Schmidt's 1/Vmax estimator in this limit is not well understood. In this work, we explore these uncertainties numerically by means of a Monte Carlo population synthesis code that simulates the kinematics and relative numbers of cooling white dwarfs. The "observationally selected" subsamples are drawn using typical proper motion and V-magnitude limits. The corresponding 1/Vmax LFs are then computed and compared to the input-integrated LFs. The results from our (noise-free) data suggest that (1) Schmidt's 1/Vmax technique is a reliable and well-behaved estimator of the true space density with typical uncertainties of \~{}50\% for 50 point samples and 25\% for 200 point samples; (2) the age uncertainties quoted in previously published observational studies of the LF are consistent with uncertainties in the Monte Carlo results--specifically, there is a \~{}15\% and <\~{}10\% observational uncertainty in the ages inferred from 50 point and 200 point samples, respectively; and (3) the large statistical variations in the bright end of these LFs--even in the large-N limit--preclude using the white dwarf LF to obtain an estimate of the recent star formation rate as a function of time.},

Our sample of 36 stars consists predominantly of nearby (\&lt;\~{}30 pc) field stars, five of which we have resolved as binaries. Two of the binary systems, 2MASSI J0429184-312356 and 2MASSI J1847034+552243, are presented here for the first time.

These have been suggested as possible locations of the lenses responsible for the microlensing events toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Three such models are investigated in detail, and the theoretical predictions are confronted with Hubble Space Telescope star count data in seven low-latitude fields (30\^{}deg<|b|<40\^{}deg). If the warped and flaring disk population has the same characteristics as disk stars in the solar neighborhood, then the models can be unambiguously ruled out. Metallicity gradients are well known in disk galaxies and may cause the outer disk population to differ in colors and luminosity from the local population. This effect is studied using a simple Ansatz for the variation in the color-magnitude relation with position, and while it is shown to lead to better agreement with the star counts, upper limits on the contribution of the warped and flaring disk to the optical depth are still below the value measured toward the LMC. Only if the warp is very asymmetric or if the luminosity function changes strongly with Galactocentric radius can the models be made consistent with the star counts.},

abstract = {Based on spectra from F and G dwarf stars, we present elemental abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks in the metallicity regime -0.8<˜ [Fe/H] <˜ +0.4. Our findings can be summarized as follows. 1) Both the thin and the thick disks show smooth and distinct abundance trends that, at sub-solar metallicities, are clearly separated. 2) For the alpha -elements the thick disk shows signatures of chemical enrichment from SNe type Ia. 3) The age of the thick disk sample is in the mean older than the thin disk sample. 4) Kinematically, there exist thick disk stars with super-solar metallicities. Based on these findings, together with other constraints from the literature, we discuss different formation scenarios for the thick disk. We suggest that the currently most likely formation scenario is a violent merger event or a close encounter with a companion galaxy. Based on kinematics the stellar sample was selected to contain stars with high probabilities of belonging either to the thin or to the thick Galactic disk. The total number of stars are 66 of which 21 belong to the thick disk and 45 to the thin disk. The analysis is based on high-resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise (R \~{} 48 000 and S/N gtrsim 150, respectively) recorded with the FEROS spectrograph on La Silla, Chile. Abundances have been determined for four alpha -elements (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), for four even-nuclei iron peak elements (Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn), and for the light elements Na and Al, from equivalent width measurements of \~{} 30 000 spectral lines. An extensive investigation of the atomic parameters, log gf-values in particular, have been performed in order to achieve abundances that are trustworthy. Noteworthy is that we find for Ti good agreement between the abundances from Ti I and Ti Ii.

This 8001-deg2 map with a resolution of 4 arcmin is provided as online material. The colour excess ratio \&lt; J - H \&gt;/\&lt; H - K \&gt; is used to determine the power-law index of the reddening law ($\beta$) for individual regions contained in the area (e.g. Orion, Perseus, Taurus, Auriga, Monoceros, Camelopardalis, Cassiopeia). On average we find a dominant value of $\beta$ = 1.8 +/- 0.2 for the individual clouds, in agreement with the canonical value for the interstellar medium. We also show that there is an internal scatter of $\beta$ values in these regions, and that in some areas more than one dominant $\beta$ values are present. This indicates large-scale variations in the dust properties. The analysis of the AV values within individual regions shows a change in the slope of the column density distribution with distance. This can be attributed either to a change in the governing physical processes in molecular clouds on spatial scales of about 1pc or to an AV dilution with distance in our map.},

@article{Kroupa2002,
abstract = {The building blocks of galaxies are star clusters. These form with low star formation efficiencies and, consequently, lose a large part of their stars that expand outwards once the residual gas is expelled by the action of the massive stars. Massive star clusters may thus add kinematically hot components to galactic field populations. This kinematical imprint on the stellar distribution function is estimated here by calculating the velocity distribution function for ensembles of star clusters distributed as power-law or log-normal initial cluster mass functions (ICMFs). The resulting stellar velocity distribution function is non-Gaussian and may be interpreted as being composed of multiple kinematical subpopulations. The velocity dispersion of solar-neighbourhood stars increases more rapidly with stellar age than theoretical calculations of orbital diffusion predict. Interpreting this difference to arise from star formation characterized by larger cluster masses, rather than as yet unknown stellar-dynamical heating mechanisms, suggests that the star formation rate in the Milky Way disc has been quietening down, or at least shifting towards less massive star-forming units. Thin-disc stars with ages 3-7Gyr may have formed from an ICMF extending to very rich Galactic clusters. Stars appear to be forming preferentially in modest embedded clusters during the past 3Gyr. Applying this approach to the ancient thick disc of the Milky Way, it follows that its large velocity dispersion may have been produced through a high star formation rate and thus an ICMF extending to massive embedded clusters (\~{}105-6Msolar), even under the extreme assumption that early star formation occurred in a thin gas-rich disc. This enhanced star formation episode in an early thin Galactic disc could have been triggered by passing satellite galaxies, but direct satellite infall into the disc may not be required for disc heating.},

@article{Haywood1997,
abstract = {Classical models of the stellar populations in our Galaxy based on exponential density laws turn out to be unsuitable to match comprehensively recent data from deep surveys at a broad variety of wavelengths. Actually, we show that such models may generate spurious interpretations of deep star-count data, resulting in biased estimates of the density characteristics of each population. Instead, a fully synthetic approach must take into account the time dependence of observable star properties as well as the dynamical constraints relating age, kinematics and space distributions. We present here comparisons of colour magnitude star-count data with the predictions of models in which the age of disc stars works as an explicit parameter connecting the star's intrinsic properties with the dynamical properties of the generation it belongs to. Hence, the history of star formation, the initial mass function, and the heating rate of the stellar disc can be tested against their respective impact on star-count data. Star counts at the galactic pole combined with the more local data investigated in Paper I (Haywood et al., 1997A\&A...320..428H) strongly favour star formation scenarios with constant or increasing SFR, while those implying a maximum of star formation activity in the early disc followed by a substantial decrease are excluded. The slope of the IMF in the mass range 1 to 3Msun\_ is found between 1.8 and 2.0 (associated with a constant SFR). Such an IMF does not produce efficient gas recycling, as a result the gas infall required to key the SFR nearly constant must be about 3.5Msun\_/pc\^{}2\^{}/Gyr. The vertical density distribution of disc stars decreases much faster than the conventionnal 300-350pc exponential scale height and simple valued exponentials used in classical models are not an adequate description of the density laws. Instead, the dynamical consistent density laws adopted in the Besancon model do fit available magnitude and colour distributions of stars over a very wide range of magnitudes. It is also shown that the thick disc contribution to faint star counts has been heavily underestimated. The whole dynamical equilibrium and fit to local and non local data is obtained under a scenario involving a moderate contribution of unseen matter to the local potential (local surface density of less than 8Msun\_/pc\^{}2\^{}) and rather limited increase of the velocity dispersion of disc stars with age ($\sigma$\_w\_<21km/s reached after more than 3Gyrs).},

abstract = {Context. H II regions and planetary nebulae (PNe) both emit at radio and infrared (IR) wavelengths, and angularly small H II regions can be mistaken for PNe. This problem of classification is most severe for H II regions in an early evolutionary stage, those that are extremely distant, or those that are both young and distant. Previous work has shown that H II regions and PNe can be separated based on their infrared colors.  Aims: Using data from the Herschel Hi-GAL survey, as well as WISE and the Spitzer MIPSGAL and GLIMPSE surveys, we wish to establish characteristic IR colors that can be used to distinguish between H II regions and PNe.  Methods: We perform aperture photometry measurements for a sample of 126 H II regions and 43 PNe at wavelengths from 8.0 $\mu$m to 500 $\mu$m.  Results: We find that H II regions and PNe have distinct IR colors. The most robust discriminating color criteria are [F12/F8] \&lt; 0.3, [F160/F12] \&gt; 1.3, and [F160/F24] \&gt; 0.8 (or alternately [F160/F22] \&gt; 0.8), where the brackets indicate the log of the flux ratio. All three of these criteria are individually satisfied by over 98\% of our sample of H II regions and by \~{}10\% of our sample of PNe. Combinations of these colors are more robust in separating the two populations; for example all H II regions and no PNe satisfy [F12/F8] \&lt; 0.4 and [F160/F22] \&gt; 0.8. When applied to objects of unknown classification, these criteria prove useful in separating the two populations. The dispersion in color is relatively small for H II regions; this suggests that any evolution in these colors with time for H II regions must be relatively modest. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of H II regions can be separated into "warm" and "cold" components. The "cold" component is well-fit by a grey-body of temperature 25 K. The SEDs of nearly two-thirds of our sample of H II regions peak at 160 $\mu$m and one third peak at 70 $\mu$m. For PNe, 67\% of the SEDs peak at 70 $\mu$m, 23\% peak at either 22 $\mu$m or 24 $\mu$m, and 9\% (two sources) peak at 160 $\mu$m.

The proper motion results suggest that the Galactic rotation curve is declining slowly at the solar distance from the Galactic Center (-2.4 +/- 1.2 km/s kpc). The component of the solar motion towards the North Galactic Pole is found to be +7.61 +/- 0.64 km/s.

abstract = {Context: The study of symbiotic stars is essential to understand important aspects of stellar evolution in interacting binaries. Their observed population in the Galaxy is however poorly known, and is one to three orders of magnitudes smaller than the predicted population size. Aims: IPHAS, the INT Photometric H$\alpha$ survey of the Northern Galactic plane, gives us the opportunity to make a systematic, complete search for symbiotic stars in a magnitude-limited volume, and discover a significant number of new systems. Methods: A method of selecting candidate symbiotic stars by combining IPHAS and near-IR (2MASS) colours is presented. It allows us to distinguish symbiotic binaries from normal stars and most of the other types of H$\alpha$ emission line stars in the Galaxy. The only exception are T Tauri stars, which can however be recognized because of their concentration in star forming regions. Results: Using these selection criteria, we discuss the classification of a list of 4338 IPHAS stars with H$\alpha$ in emission. 1500 to 2000 of them are likely to be Be stars. Among the remaining objects, 1183 fulfill our photometric constraints to be considered candidate symbiotic stars. The spectroscopic confirmation of three of these objects, which are the first new symbiotic stars discovered by IPHAS, proves the potential of the survey and selection method.

abstract = {We used fully cosmological, high-resolution N-body + smooth particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations to follow the formation of disc galaxies with rotational velocities between 135 and 270kms-1 in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) universe. The simulations include gas cooling, star formation, the effects of a uniform ultraviolet (UV) background and a physically motivated description of feedback from supernovae (SNe). The host dark matter haloes have a spin and last major merger redshift typical of galaxy-sized haloes as measured in recent large-scale N-body simulations. The simulated galaxies form rotationally supported discs with realistic exponential scalelengths and fall on both the I band and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations. An extended stellar disc forms inside the Milky Way (MW)-sized halo immediately after the last major merger. The combination of UV background and SN feedback drastically reduces the number of visible satellites orbiting inside a MW-sized halo, bringing it in fair agreement with observations. Our simulations predict that the average age of a primary galaxy's stellar population decreases with mass, because feedback delays star formation in less massive galaxies. Galaxies have stellar masses and current star formation rates as a function of total mass that are in good agreement with observational data. We discuss how both high mass and force resolution and a realistic description of star formation and feedback are important ingredients to match the observed properties of galaxies.},

The survey will begin in fall of 2012, and will run for at least four years. The telescope design constrains the optimal declination range for observations to \$10\^{}\backslash circ<\backslash delta<50\^{}\backslash circ\$, and site conditions lead to an emphasis on stars in the direction of the Galactic anticenter. The survey is divided into three parts with different target selection strategies: disk, anticenter, and spheroid. The resulting dataset will be used to study the merger history of the Milky Way, the substructure and evolution of the disks, the nature of the first generation of stars through identification of the lowest metallicity stars, and star formation through study of open clusters and the OB associations.

abstract = {We describe TRILEGAL, a new populations synthesis code for simulating the stellar photometry of any Galaxy field. The code attempts to improve upon several technical aspects of star count models, by: dealing with very complete input libraries of evolutionary tracks; using a stellar spectral library to simulate the photometry in virtually any broad-band system; being very versatile allowing easy changes in the input libraries and in the description of all of its ingredients - like the star formation rate, age-metallicity relation, initial mass function, and geometry of Galaxy components. In a previous paper (Groenewegen et al. 2002, Paper I), the code was first applied to describe the very deep star counts of the CDFS stellar catalogue. Here, we briefly describe its initial calibration using EIS-deep and DMS star counts, which, as we show, are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc components of largest scale heights (oldest ages). We then present the changes in the calibration that were necessary to cope with some improvements in the model input data, and the use of more extensive photometry datasets: now the code is shown to successfully simulate also the relatively shallower 2MASS catalogue, which probes mostly the disc at intermediate ages, and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled by Hipparcos - in particular its absolute magnitude versus colour diagram -, which contains a somewhat larger fraction of younger stars than deeper surveys. Remarkably, the same model calibration can reproduce well the star counts in all the above-mentioned data sets, that span from the very deep magnitudes of CDFS (16\&lt;R\&lt;23) to the very shallow ones of Hipparcos (V\&lt;8). Significant deviations (above 50 percent in number counts) are found just for fields close to the Galactic Center (since no bulge component was included) and Plane, and for a single set of South Galactic Pole data. The TRILEGAL code is ready to use for the variety of wide-angle surveys in the optical/infrared that will become available in the coming years.},

The catalogue covers the magnitude range 13 <= r' <= 19.5 and includes Northern hemisphere sources in the Galactic latitude range -5° < b < 5°. It is derived from \~{}1500 deg2 worth of imaging data, which represents 80 per cent of the final IPHAS survey area. The electronic version of the catalogue will be updated once the full survey data become available. In total, the present catalogue contains 4853 point sources that exhibit strong photometric evidence for H$\alpha$ emission. We have so far analysed spectra for \~{}300 of these sources, confirming more than 95 per cent of them as genuine emission-line stars. A wide range of stellar populations are represented in the catalogue, including early-type emission-line stars, active late-type stars, interacting binaries, young stellar objects and compact nebulae. The spatial distribution of catalogue objects shows overdensities near sites of recent or current star formation, as well as possible evidence for the warp of the Galactic plane. Photometrically, the incidence of H$\alpha$ emission is bimodally distributed in (r' - i'). The blue peak is made up mostly of early-type emission-line stars, whereas the red peak may signal an increasing contribution from other objects, such as young/active low-mass stars. We have cross-matched our H$\alpha$-excess catalogue against the emission-line star catalogue of Kohoutek \& Wehmeyer, as well as against sources in SIMBAD. We find that fewer than 10 per cent of our sources can be matched to known objects of any type. Thus IPHAS is uncovering an order of magnitude more faint (r' > 13) emission-line objects than were previously known in the Milky Way.},

In this paper we discuss the stellar populations and kinematics toward the North Galactic Pole (NGP) using data taken from the Guide Star Catalog II. Methods: .The Padova Galaxy model has been upgraded including the possibility of simulating in a consistent way color magnitude diagrams, luminosity functions and proper motions. Particular care is paid to simulate the kinematics of the thin disk, using a velocity dispersion tensor with off-diagonal term accounting for the vertical tilt. Results: .To reproduce the observational color distribution of the studied fields, one of the most critical parameters is the IMF slope. The canonical Kroupa IMF gives a poor fit of the data. The most convincing solutions are obtained assuming that about 40\% of the stars are in binaries and that the initial mass function changes slope at 0.8 M\_ȯ instead than at the canonical value of 0.5 M\_ȯ. We derive a Thin Disk IMF slope of $\alpha$ = 0.9 ± 0.2 in the mass range 0.2-0.8 M\_ȯ. We derive the velocity ellipsoids of the Thin disk populations. The Thick disk and the Thin disk are well separated concerning their kinematic properties. The Thick disk is found to have a mean rotational velocity of overline \{vc \} = 178 ± 8 \{km s\} - 1 implying a moderate rotational lag with respect to the solar motion. The data are not consistent with a significant vertical velocity gradient. This points in favor of a formation of the Thick disk by a quick heating of the precursor disk. Finally, no significant rotation velocity is found in the Halo.},

The combination of shallow fields dominated by stars at the turnoff with deep fields allows the determination of the thick disc mass function in the mass range 0.2-0.8 Msun. Star counts are compared with simulations of a synthesis population model. The fit is based on a maximum likelihood criterion. The best fit model gives a scale height of 800 pc, a scale length of 2500 pc and a local density of 10-3 stars pc-3 or 7.1 x 10-4 Msun pc-3 for M\_v <= 8.

This article is a follow-up to previous work, where the expected Gaia Catalogue content was reviewed but without the simulation of observational errors.  Methods: We analysed the Gaia Object Generator (GOG) catalogue using the Gaia Analysis Tool (GAT), thereby producing a number of statistics about the catalogue.  Results: A simulated catalogue of one billion objects is presented, with detailed information on the 523 million individual single stars it contains. Detailed information is provided for the expected errors in parallax, position, proper motion, radial velocity, and the photometry in the four Gaia bands.

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the star formation history (SFH) of three fields in M33 located approximately four to six visual scale lengths from its nucleus. These fields were imaged with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope and reach \~{}2.5 mag below the red clump of core helium-burning stars. The observed color-magnitude diagrams are modeled as linear combinations of individual synthetic populations with different ages and metallicities. To gain a better understanding of the systematic errors, we have conducted the analysis with two different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks, which we designate as Padova and Teramo. The precise details of the results depend on which tracks are used, but we can make several conclusions that are fairly robust despite the differences. Both sets of tracks predict the mean age to increase and the mean metallicity to decrease with radius. Allowing age and metallicity to be free parameters and assuming that star formation began \~{}14 Gyr ago, we find that the mean age of all stars and stellar remnants increases from \~{}6 to \~{}8 Gyr, and the mean global metallicity decreases from approximately -0.7 to approximately -0.9. The fraction of stars formed by 4.5 Gyr ago increases from \~{}65\% to \~{}80\%. The mean star formation rate 80-800 Myr ago decreases from \~{}30\% of the lifetime average to just \~{}5\%. The random errors on these estimates are \~{}10\%, 1.0 Gyr, and 0.1 dex. By comparing the results of the two sets of stellar tracks for the real data and for test populations with known SFHs, we have estimated the systematic errors to be 15\%, 1.0 Gyr, and 0.2 dex. These do not include uncertainties in the bolometric corrections or variations in $\alpha$-element abundance, which deserve future study.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that at low metallicities Doppler-detected planet-hosting stars tend to have high $\alpha$-content and to belong to the thick disk. We used the reconnaissance spectra of 87 Kepler planet candidates and data available from the HARPS planet search survey to explore this phenomenon. Using the traditional spectroscopic abundance analysis methods, we derived Ti, Ca, and Cr abundances for the Kepler stars. In the metallicity region -0.65 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt; -0.3 dex, the fraction of Ti-enhanced thick-disk HARPS planet harboring stars is 12.3 ± 4.1\%, and for their thin-disk counterparts this fraction is 2.2 ± 1.3\%. Binomial statistics give a probability of 0.008 that this could have occurred by chance. Combining the two samples (HARPS and Kepler) reinforces the significance of this result (P \~{} 99.97\%). Since most of these stars harbor small sized or low-mass planets we can assume that, although terrestrial planets can be found in a low-iron regime, they are mostly enhanced by $\alpha$-elements. This implies that early formation of rocky planets could start in the Galactic thick disk, where the chemical conditions for their formation are more favorable.

abstract = {We have carried out a multiwavelength study of the plane of our Galaxy in order to establish a star-forming-complex catalogue which is as complete as possible. Features observed include H$\alpha$ , H109alpha , CO, the radio continuum and absorption lines. For each complex we have determined the position, the systemic velocity, the kinematic distance and, when possible, the stellar distance and the corresponding uncertainties. All of these parameters were determined as homogeneously as possible, in particular all the stellar distances have been (re)calculated with the same calibration and the kinematic distances with the same mean Galactic rotation curve. Through the complexes with stellar distance determination, a rotation curve has been fitted. It is in good agreement with the one of Brand \&amp; Blitz (1993). We also investigated the residual velocities relative to the circular rotation model. We find that departures exist over large areas of the arms, with different values from one arm to another. From our data and in good agreement with previous studies, the Galactic warp is observed. It does not seem correlated with the departures from circular rotation. Finally, as segment-like features are noted from the complexes' distribution, we tried to find if they are indicative of a larger underlying structure. Then, we attempted to interpret the complexes' distribution in terms of spiral structure by fitting models with two, three and four logarithmic spiral arms. The four-arm model seems more appropriate to represent the grand design of our Galaxy. In this model the Norma arm and the external arm appear as being the two extremities of a single arm called the Norma-Cygnus arm. The new data and fitted model confirm the four-segment model of Georgelin \&amp; Georgelin (1976), clarifying the arms' design and extension and doubling their known length.

@article{Cole2000,
abstract = {We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology f12(M1,M2) dM1 [1/√2$\pi$] [($\delta$c1 - $\delta$c2)/ ($\sigma$21 - $\sigma$22)3/2] x exp [-($\delta$c1 - $\delta$c2)2/ 2($\sigma$22)] [d$\sigma$21/dM1] d M1 ($\Omega$0=0.3) (df12)/(dt1 t1t2) dM1 dt1 [1/√(2$\pi$)] [1 / $\sigma$21 - $\sigma$22)3/2] [d$\delta$c1/dt1] [d$\sigma$21/dM1] dM1 dt1 $\Lambda$0=0.7),-> and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since [dN/dM1] [df12/dt1] [M2/M1] dt1 (M1 < M2). z <\~{}1.5.},

We compare the kinematics of CMa M-giant selected sample with surrounding Galactic disk stars in the UCAC2 catalog and find no peculiar proper motion signature: CMa stars mimic thick disk kinematics. Moreover, when taking into account the Galactic warp and flare of the disk, 2MASS star count profiles reproduce the CMa stellar over-density.

Its footprint spans the Galactic latitude range -5o < b < +5° at all longitudes south of the celestial equator. Extensions around the Galactic Centre to Galactic latitudes ±10° bring in much of the Galactic bulge. This European Southern Observatory public survey, begun on 2011 December 28, reaches down to ˜20th magnitude (10$\sigma$) and will provide single-epoch digital optical photometry for ˜300 million stars. The observing strategy and data pipelining are described, and an appraisal of the segmented narrow-band H$\alpha$ filter in use is presented. Using model atmospheres and library spectra, we compute main-sequence (u - g), (g - r), (r - i) and (r - H$\alpha$) stellar colours in the Vega system. We report on a preliminary validation of the photometry using test data obtained from two pointings overlapping the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. An example of the (u - g, g - r) and (r - H$\alpha$, r - i) diagrams for a full VPHAS+ survey field is given. Attention is drawn to the opportunities for studies of compact nebulae and nebular morphologies that arise from the image quality being achieved. The value of the u band as the means to identify planetary-nebula central stars is demonstrated by the discovery of the central star of NGC 2899 in survey data. Thanks to its excellent imaging performance, the VLT Survey Telescope (VST)/OmegaCam combination used by this survey is a perfect vehicle for automated searches for reddened early-type stars, and will allow the discovery and analysis of compact binaries, white dwarfs and transient sources.},

abstract = {We present H$\alpha$ images of an ionized nebula surrounding the M2-5Ia red supergiant (RSG) W26 in the massive star cluster Westerlund 1. The nebula consists of a circumstellar shell or ring ˜0.1 pc in diameter and a triangular nebula ˜0.2 pc from the star that in high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images shows a complex filamentary structure. The excitation mechanism of both regions is unclear since RSGs are too cool to produce ionizing photons and we consider various possibilities. The presence of the nebula, high stellar luminosity and spectral variability suggests that W26 is a highly evolved RSG experiencing extreme levels of mass-loss. As the only known example of an ionized nebula surrounding an RSG W26 deserves further attention to improve our understanding of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars.},
